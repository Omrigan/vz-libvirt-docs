.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBvirtqemud\fP [\fIOPTION\fP]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The \fBvirtqemud\fP program is a server side daemon component of the libvirt
virtualization management system.
.sp
It is one of a collection of modular daemons that replace functionality
previously provided by the monolithic \fBlibvirtd\fP daemon.
.sp
This daemon runs on virtualization hosts to provide management for QEMU virtual
machines.
.sp
The \fBvirtqemud\fP daemon only listens for requests on a local Unix domain
socket. Remote off\-host access and backwards compatibility with legacy
clients expecting \fBlibvirtd\fP is provided by the \fBvirtproxy\fP daemon.
.sp
Restarting \fBvirtqemud\fP does not interrupt running guests. Guests continue to
operate and changes in their state will generally be picked up automatically
during startup. None the less it is recommended to avoid restarting with
running guests whenever practical.
.SH SYSTEM SOCKET ACTIVATION
.sp
The \fBvirtqemud\fP daemon is capable of starting in two modes.
.sp
In the traditional mode, it will create and listen on UNIX sockets itself.
.sp
In socket activation mode, it will rely on systemd to create and listen
on the UNIX sockets and pass them as pre\-opened file descriptors. In this
mode most of the socket related config options in
\fB/etc/libvirt/virtqemud.conf\fP will no longer have any effect.
.sp
Socket activation mode is generally the default when running on a host
OS that uses systemd. To revert to the traditional mode, all the socket
unit files must be masked:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ systemctl mask virtqemud.socket virtqemud\-ro.socket \e
   virtqemud\-admin.socket
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If using libvirt\-guests service then the ordering for that service needs to be
adapted so that it is ordered after the service unit instead of the socket unit.
Since dependencies and ordering cannot be changed with drop\-in overrides, the
whole libvirt\-guests unit file needs to be changed.  In order to preserve such
change copy the installed \fB/usr/lib/systemd/system/libvirt\-guests.service\fP to
\fB/etc/systemd/system/libvirt\-guests.service\fP and make the change there,
specifically make sure the \fBAfter=\fP ordering mentions \fBvirtqemud.service\fP and
not \fBvirtqemud.socket\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.nf

.sp
Run as a daemon & write PID file.
.sp
\fB\-f\fP, \fB\-\-config *FILE*\fP
.sp
Use this configuration file, overriding the default value.
.sp

.SH FILES
.SS When run as \fIroot\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB/etc/libvirt/virtqemud.conf\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
The default configuration file used by \fBvirtqemud\fP, unless overridden on the
command line using the \fB\-f\fP | \fB\-\-config\fP option.
.sp
In addition to the default configuration file, \fBvirtqemud\fP reads
configuration for the QEMU driver from:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB/etc/libvirt/qemu.conf\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
This file contains various knobs and default values for virtual machines
created within QEMU driver, and offers a way to override the built in defaults,
for instance (but not limited to): paths to various supplementary binaries, TLS
certificates location, graphical consoles configuration and others. Location of
this file can\(aqt be overridden by any command line switch.
.INDENT 0.0

configuration for the qemu driver from:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/libvirt/qemu.conf\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
