<h1>libvirt releases</h1>

<p>This is the list of official releases for libvirt, along with an overview of
the changes introduced by each of them.</p>
<p>For a more fine-grained view, use the <a class="reference external" href="https://gitlab.com/libvirt/libvirt/-/commits/master">git log</a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="v8-5-0-2022-07-01">
<h1>v8.5.0 (2022-07-01)<a class="headerlink" href="#v8-5-0-2022-07-01" title="Link to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>New features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>qemu: Introduce support for network backed NVRAM</p>
<p>Users can now use remote store NVRAM image by specifying newly introduced
attribute <cite>type='network'</cite> with <cite>&lt;nvram&gt;</cite> element.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Add support for post-copy migration recovery</p>
<p>A new <span class="docutils literal">VIR_MIGRATE_POSTCOPY_RESUME</span> flag (<span class="docutils literal">virsh migrate <span class="pre">--postcopy-resume</span></span>)
was introduced for recovering from a failed post-copy migration.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Introduce thread_pool_min and thread_pool_max attributes to IOThread</p>
<p>New attributes <span class="docutils literal">thread_pool_min</span> and <span class="docutils literal">thread_pool_max</span> were introduced
to <span class="docutils literal">&lt;iothread/&gt;</span> as well as new <span class="docutils literal">&lt;defaultiothread/&gt;</span> element with the
same attributes. This way it's possible to instruct QEMU to spawn enough
worker threads for an IOThread upfront, resulting in predictable time
needed to process an I/O request.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improvements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Define a TFTP server without a DHCP server in network configuration</p>
<p>It's now possible to define a network with no DHCP server but with a TFTP
server. This may be useful when DHCP service is provided by other entity on
the network than libvirt spawned dnsmasq.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Bug fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>qemu: Restore label to temp file in qemuDomainScreenshot()</p>
<p>When virDomainScreenshot() is called, libvirt instructs QEMU to save the
screenshot into a temporary file. This file needs to be labelled correctly,
so that QEMU can access it. And since the file is temporary (it's deleted
after the screenshot was taken) the corresponding label restore was
missing. This proven to be problematic for profile based models, like
AppArmor, where the temporary files were added into the profile but never
removed, which resulted in longer profile recalculation times.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemuBuildInterfaceConnect: Initialize @tapfd array</p>
<p>Due to an uninitialized array, unsuccessful attempt to start a guest with
an <span class="docutils literal">&lt;interface/&gt;</span> might have resulted in closing of a random FD and thus
sudden disconnect of a client or other random failures.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Fix hotplug of network interfaces</p>
<p>A logic bug introduced in a recent refactor was fixed. The bug caused a
problem when hot-adding a network interface, which failed with the
following error:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">error: internal error: unable to execute QEMU command 'netdev_add': File descriptor named '(null)' has not been found</pre>
</li>
<li><p>Fix <span class="docutils literal">startupPolicy</span> validation for <span class="docutils literal">block</span> disks</p>
<p>Setting of <span class="docutils literal">startupPolicy</span> for a block disk would result in an error due
to a logic bug in a recent refactor.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Fix crash when overriding device properties via <span class="docutils literal">&lt;qemu:override&gt;</span> element</p>
<p>Adding an override for a device property would result in a crash of the qemu
driver.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="v8-4-0-2022-06-01">
<h1>v8.4.0 (2022-06-01)<a class="headerlink" href="#v8-4-0-2022-06-01" title="Link to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>New features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>qemu: D-Bus display</p>
<p>Libvirt is now able to setup a D-Bus display export, either with a private
bus or in p2p mode. This display is available in QEMU 7.0.0.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: ppc64 Power10 processor support</p>
<p>Support for the recently released IBM Power10 processor was added.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Introduce <span class="docutils literal">absolute</span> clock offset</p>
<p>The <span class="docutils literal">absolute</span> clock offset type allows to set the guest clock to an
arbitrary epoch timestamp at each start. This is useful if some VM needs
to be kept set to an arbitrary time for e.g. testing or working around
broken software.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: add qemu-vdagent channel</p>
<p>This paravirtualized qemu vdagent channel can enable copy and paste between
a guest and a VNC client. It is available in QEMU 6.1.0.</p>
</li>
<li><p>api: Add new APIs <span class="docutils literal">virDomainSaveParams</span> and <span class="docutils literal">virDomainRestoreParams</span></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><span class="docutils literal">virDomainSaveParams</span>: An alternative domain saving API, extends
<span class="docutils literal">virDomainSaveFlags</span> by adding parameters.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="docutils literal">virDomainRestoreParams</span>: An alternative domain restoring API, extends
<span class="docutils literal">virDomainRestoreFlags</span> by adding parameters.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Bug fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Improve heuristics for computing baseline CPU models</p>
<p>Both <span class="docutils literal">virConnectBaselineHypervisorCPU</span> and <span class="docutils literal">virConnectBaselineCPU</span> were
in some cases computing the result using a CPU model which was newer than
some of the input models. For example, <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Cascadelake-Server</span></span> was used as a
baseline for <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Skylake-Server-IBRS</span></span> and <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Cascadelake-Server</span></span>. The CPU
model selection heuristics was improved to choose a more appropriate model.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="v8-3-0-2022-05-02">
<h1>v8.3.0 (2022-05-02)<a class="headerlink" href="#v8-3-0-2022-05-02" title="Link to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Removed features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>qemu: Remove support for QEMU &lt; 3.1</p>
<p>In accordance with our platform support policy, the oldest supported QEMU
version is now bumped from 2.11 to 3.1.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>New features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>qemu: Introduce support for virtio-iommu</p>
<p>This IOMMU device can be used with both Q35 and ARM virt guests.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Introduce attributes rss and rss_hash_report for net interface</p>
<p>They can enable in-qemu/ebpf RSS and in-qemu RSS hash report for virtio NIC.
Require QEMU &gt;= 5.1.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="v8-2-0-2022-04-01">
<h1>v8.2.0 (2022-04-01)<a class="headerlink" href="#v8-2-0-2022-04-01" title="Link to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>New features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>qemu: Introduce <span class="docutils literal">manual</span> disk snapshot mode</p>
<p>This new mode allows users to synchronize libvirt snapshots with snapshots
which need to be done outside of libvirt e.g. when 'vhost-user-blk' is used
to back the disk.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Introduce memory allocation threads</p>
<p>When starting a QEMU guest, libvirt can now instruct QEMU to allocate
guest's memory in parallel. This may be handy when guest has large amounts
of memory.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improvements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>qemu: <span class="docutils literal">VIR_MIGRATE_PARAM_TLS_DESTINATION</span> now works with non-shared storage migration</p>
<p>The setting now also applies to the NBD connections for non-shared storage
migration allowing migration to proceed even when the user expects certificate
name not to match.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Allow overrides of device properties via the qemu namespace</p>
<p>Users wishing to override or modify properties of devices configured by
libvirt can use the <span class="docutils literal">&lt;qemu:deviceOverride&gt;</span> QEMU namespace element to
specify the overrides instead of relying on the argv passthrough of the
<span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-set</span></span> qemu commandline option which no longer works with new qemu.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Allow passing file descriptors to <span class="docutils literal">virsh <span class="pre">qemu-monitor-command</span></span></p>
<p>Passing FDs allows users wanting to experiment with qemu driven by libvirt
use commands like <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">add-fd</span></span> properly.</p>
</li>
<li><p>libxl: Turn on user aliases</p>
<p>Users can now use so called user aliases for XEN domains.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Implement support for FUSE3</p>
<p>The LXC driver uses fuse to overwrite some lines in <span class="docutils literal">/proc/meminfo</span>
inside containers so that they see correct amount of memory given to them.
The code was changed so that both <span class="docutils literal">fuse</span> and <span class="docutils literal">fuse3</span> are supported.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Improve domain save/restore throughput</p>
<p>Code that's handling save or restore of QEMU domains was changed resulting
in better performance of I/O and thus shortening time needed for the operation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Bug fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Both build and tests should now pass on Alpine Linux or any other
distribution with musl libc.</p></li>
<li><p>virsh: Fix integer overflow in allocpages</p>
<p>On hosts which support hugepages larger than 1GiB <span class="docutils literal">virsh allocpages</span>
failed to accept them because of an integer overflow. This is now fixed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Fix segmentation fault in virDomainUndefineFlags</p>
<p>When a domain without any <span class="docutils literal">&lt;loader/&gt;</span> was being undefined, libvirt has
crashed. This is now fixed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>lxc: Fix unaligned reads of /proc/meminfo within a container</p>
<p>When /proc/meminfo was read in chunks smaller than the entire file, libvirt
would produce mangled output. While porting the code to FUSE3 this area was
reworked and the file can now be read with any granularity.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Be less aggressive around cgroup_device_acl</p>
<p>A basic set of devices common to every domain can be set in <span class="docutils literal">qemu.conf</span>
via cgroup_device_acl knob. Devices from this set are allowed in CGroup and
created in domain private namespace for every domain. However, upon device
hotunplug it may have had happened that libvirt mistakenly denied a device
from this set and/or removed it from the namespace. For instance,
/dev/urandom was removed and denied in CGroup on RNG hotunplug.</p>
</li>
<li><p>nodedev: trigger mdev device definition update on udev add and remove</p>
<p>When nodedev objects are added and removed mdev device definitions are
updated to report correct associated parent.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="v8-1-0-2022-03-01">
<h1>v8.1.0 (2022-03-01)<a class="headerlink" href="#v8-1-0-2022-03-01" title="Link to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>New features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>qemu: Add hvf domain type for Hypervisor.framework</p>
<p>It works on Intel machines as well as recent machines powered by Apple
Silicon. QEMU 6.2.0 is needed for Apple Silicon support.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Support mode option for dirtyrate calculation</p>
<p>Introduce <span class="docutils literal">virDomainDirtyRateCalcFlags</span> as parameter of
<span class="docutils literal">virDomainStartDirtyRateCalc</span>, which is used to specify the mode of
dirty page rate calculation.</p>
<p>Add <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--mode</span></span> option to <span class="docutils literal">virsh <span class="pre">domdirtyrate-calc</span></span>, which can be
either of the following 3 options:
<span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">page-sampling,</span> <span class="pre">dirty-bitmap,</span> <span class="pre">dirty-ring</span></span>.</p>
<p>Add <span class="docutils literal">calc_mode</span> field for dirtyrate statistics returned by
<span class="docutils literal">virsh domstats <span class="pre">--dirtyrate</span></span>, also add <span class="docutils literal">vCPU dirtyrate</span> if
<span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dirty-ring</span></span> mode was used in last measurement.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improvements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>packaging: sysconfig files no longer installed</p>
<p>libvirt used to provide defaults in various /etc/sysconfig/ files, such
as /etc/sysconfig/libvirtd. Since these files are owned by the admin, this
made it difficult to change built-in defaults in case such file was
modified by the admin. The built-in defaults are now part of the provided
systemd unit files, such as libvirtd.service. These unit files continue
to parse sysconfig files, in case they are created by the admin and filled
with the desired key=value pairs.</p>
</li>
<li><p>virnetdev: Ignore EPERM on implicit clearing of VF VLAN ID</p>
<p>Libvirt will now ignore EPERM errors on attempts to implicitly clear a
VLAN ID (when a VLAN is not explicitly provided via an interface XML
using a 0 or a non-zero value) as SmartNIC DPUs do not expose VLAN
programming capabilities to the hypervisor host. This allows Libvirt
clients to avoid specifying a VLAN and expect VF configuration to work
since Libvirt tries to clear a VLAN in the same operation
as setting a MAC address for VIR_DOMAIN_NET_TYPE_HOSTDEV devices which
is now split into two distinct operations. EPERM errors received while
trying to program a non-zero VLAN ID or explicitly program a VLAN ID 0
will still cause errors as before so there is no change in behavior
in those cases.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Bug fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Remove unix sockets from filesystem when disabling a '.socket' systemd unit</p>
<p>The presence of the socket files is used by our remote driver to determine
which service to access. Since neither systemd nor the daemons clean up the
socket file clients were running into problems when a modular deployment was
switched to monolithic <span class="docutils literal">libvirtd</span>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Fixes of fd passing during hotplug and hotunplug of chardevs</p>
<p>FDs used as chardev backing are now properly removed when hot-unplugging
a chardev from qemu and hotplugged chardevs now properly use <span class="docutils literal">virtlogd</span>
to handle the input and output from qemu.</p>
</li>
<li><p>RPM: Run pre/post-install steps on <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">daemon-driver-storage-core</span></span></p>
<p>Previously the pre/post-install code was part of the meta-package which
installed all storage driver sub-packages thus a minimalistic install
of the storage driver didn't behave correctly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="v8-0-0-2022-01-14">
<h1>v8.0.0 (2022-01-14)<a class="headerlink" href="#v8-0-0-2022-01-14" title="Link to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>libxl: Fix potential deadlock and crash (CVE-2021-4147)</p>
<p>A rogue guest could continuously reboot itself and cause libvirtd on the
host to deadlock or crash, resulting in a denial of service condition.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Removed features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>qemu: Explicitly forbid live changing nodeset for strict numatune</p>
<p>For <span class="docutils literal">strict</span> mode of &lt;numatune/&gt; it can't be guaranteed that memory is
moved completely onto new set of nodes (e.g. QEMU might have locked pieces
of its memory) thus breaking the strict promise. If live migration of QEMU
memory between NUMA nodes is desired, users are advised to use
<span class="docutils literal">restrictive</span> mode instead.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>New features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>qemu: Synchronous write mode for disk copy operations</p>
<p>The <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">blockdev-mirror</span></span> block job supports a mode where writes from the VM
are synchronously propagated to the destination of the copy. This ensures
that the job will converge under heavy I/O.</p>
<p>Implement the mode for the copy blockjob as
<span class="docutils literal">VIR_DOMAIN_BLOCK_COPY_SYNCHRONOUS_WRITES</span> flag exposed via
<span class="docutils literal">virsh blockcopy <span class="pre">--synchronous-writes</span></span> and for non-shared storage migration
as <span class="docutils literal">VIR_MIGRATE_NON_SHARED_SYNCHRONOUS_WRITES</span> exposed via
<span class="docutils literal">virsh migrate <span class="pre">--copy-storage-synchronous-writes</span></span>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Introduce TCG domain features</p>
<p>Libvirt is now able to set the size of translation block cache size
(tb-size) for TCG domains.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Add new API to inject a launch secret in a domain</p>
<p>New API <span class="docutils literal">virDomainSetLaunchSecurityState()</span> and virsh command
<span class="docutils literal">domsetlaunchsecstate</span> are added to support injecting a launch secret
in a domain's memory.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improvements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>libxl: Implement the virDomainGetMessages API</p></li>
<li><p>qemu: Preserve qcow2 sub-cluster allocation state after external snapshots and block-copy</p>
<p>The new image which is installed as an overlay on top of the current chain
when taking an external snapshot, or the target of a block copy operation
now enables sub-cluster allocation (<span class="docutils literal">extended_l2</span>) if the original
image has the option enabled.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Bug fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>qemu: Fix device hot-unplug with <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">libvirt-7.9</span></span> or <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">libvirt-7.10</span></span> used with <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">qemu-6.2</span></span></p>
<p>An internal change to the configuration format used by the above libvirt
versions triggers a bug in <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">qemu-6.2</span></span> where qemu no longer emits the
event notifying that the device was unplugged successfully and thus libvirt
never removes the device from the definition.</p>
<p>This impacts only devices which were present at startup of the VM, hotplugged
devices behave correctly.</p>
<p>This is fixed in <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">libvirt-8.0</span></span> by reverting to the old configuration
approach until qemu is fixed.</p>
<p>As a workaround for <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">libvirt-7.9</span></span> and <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">libvirt-7.10</span></span> the old configuration
approach can be forced by:</p>
<p>Option 1, global <span class="docutils literal">qemu.conf</span>:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">capability_filters = [ "device.json" ]</pre>
<p>Option 2, per VM XML override:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">&lt;domain type='kvm' xmlns:qemu='http://libvirt.org/schemas/domain/qemu/1.0'&gt;

 [...]

 &lt;qemu:capabilities&gt;
   &lt;qemu:del capability='device.json'/&gt;
 &lt;/qemu:capabilities&gt;
&lt;/domain&gt;</pre>
</li>
<li><p>Fix sparse streams with split daemon</p>
<p>In split daemon scenario, a client connected to a hypervisor driver and
using sparse streams (e.g. <span class="docutils literal">virsh <span class="pre">vol-download</span> <span class="pre">--sparse</span></span>) would make the
hypervisor daemon enter an infinite loop without any data transfer. This is
now fixed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Build no longer requires RPC library</p>
<p>Code and its cross dependencies were fixed so that build without remote
driver and thus an RPC library (like <span class="docutils literal">tirpc</span>) fails no more.</p>
</li>
<li><p>virnetdevopenvswitch: Fix 'burst' value passed to ovs-vsctl</p>
<p>When a <span class="docutils literal">&lt;bandwidth/&gt;</span> was defined for a TAP device that's plugged into an
OvS bridge values passed to the OvS were incorrectly recalculated resulting
in slightly different limits being applied.</p>

<li><p><strong>New features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Added virt-pki-query-dn binary</p>
<p>This binary helps users figure out the format of Distinguished Name
from a certificate file the way that libvirt expects it in
tls_allowed_dn_list option of libvirtd.conf configuration file</p>

<li><p><strong>Improvements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>qemu: Report guest interface information in <span class="docutils literal">virDomainGetGuestInfo</span></p>
<p>Libvirt is now able to report interface information from the guest's
perspective (using guest agent).</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: detect guest side errors during device removal</p>
<p>Libvirt is now able to detect guest side errors during device removal by
using the DEVICE_UNPLUG_GUEST_ERROR event, available in QEMU 6.2.0.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Minimum SSF setting</p>
<p>The libvirtd.conf option tcp_min_ssf can be used to override the minimum
permitted security strength factor for non-TLS remote connections.
The current hardcoded minimum is 56 (single-DES) and will be raised to 112
in the future. Setting a minimum lower than 112 is not supported.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Report stats also for block copy destination and backup job scratch
images</p>
<p>The statistics are available via the bulk domain stats API.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Bug fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>qemu: Don't format 'ramfb' attribute when disabled</p>
<p>Fix a regression caused by the conversion to JSON -device arguments where
'ramfb' would be put on the commandline of 'vfio-pci' which doesn't have it,
thus breaking VMs with a mediated host device.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Fix block copy and backup to encrypted storage</p>
<p>An oversight in last release lead to a spurious error being reported when
encrypted storage was requested for disk images which are not directly
backing the disk, which is now fixed.</p>

<p>the &lt;target hotplug='on|off'/&gt; option is now supported for the
pci-root controller on i440fx-based (x86 "pc") machinetypes. This
can be used to disable hotplug/unplug of devices from this
controller. The default behavior is unchanged (hotplug is
allowed).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Support hotplug and hotunplug for virtiofs</p>
<p>Filesystems backed by virtiofsd can now be hotplugged and hotunplugged.</p>
</li>
<li><p>virpcivpd: Add a PCI VPD parser</p>
<p>A parser for the standard PCI/PCIe VPD ("I.3. VPD Definitions" in PCI 2.2+
and an equivalent definition in "6.28.1 VPD Format" PCIe 4.0) was added
along with relevant types to represent PCI VPD in memory. This
functionality got added for Linux only at this point (kernels above
v2.6.26 have support for exposing VPD via sysfs).</p>
</li>
<li><p>virpci: Add PCI VPD-related helper functions to virpci</p>
<p>In order to utilize the PCI VPD parser, a couple of helper functions got
introduced to check for the presence of a VPD file in the sysfs tree and
to invoke the PCI VPD parser to get a list of resources representing PCI
VPD contents in memory.</p>
</li>
<li><p>nodedev: Add PCI VPD capability support</p>
<p>Support for serializing and deserializing PCI VPD data structures is added
following the addition of the PCI VPD parser. A new PCI device capability
called "vpd" is introduced holding string resources and keyword resources
found in PCI VPD.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Support page_per_vq for driver element</p>
<p>This optional virtio attribute <span class="docutils literal">page_per_vq</span> controls the layout of the
notification capabilities exposed to the guest. It is recommended for the
vDPA devices.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Support librbd encryption</p>
<p>Add an encryption engine <span class="docutils literal">librbd</span>. It will provides the image-level
encryption of librbd. It requires QEMU &gt;= 6.1.0 and librbd &gt;= 16.1.0.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improvements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Use of JSON syntax with <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-device</span></span> with upcoming QEMU-6.2</p>
<p>Libvirt started using JSON directly with the <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-device</span></span> commandline
parameter as it's considered the preferred stable syntax for further QEMU
releases. If any problems with the conversion are encountered please
report them as soon as possible.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Bug fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>qemu: Fix problems on <span class="docutils literal">virsh domstats</span> with qemu &lt;5.2.0</p>
<p>Libvirt v7.2.0 and later called query-dirty-rate, which was introduced in
qemu-5.2.0, regardless of qemu version and failed in qemu-5.1.0. This
release fixes the bug.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>Don't enter endless loop when unable to accept new clients</p>
<p>If libvirtd (or any other daemon) hit the ulimit for maximum number of open
files but there are still client connections pending then libvirtd (or
corresponding split daemon) would enter an endless loop from which it would
never recover. This behaviour is now fixed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Run secondary driver hooks in split daemon mode</p>
<p>Because of a bug in implementation it may happen that hooks from secondary
drivers were not called in all cases, for instance a network hook wasn't
called upon removal of interface after domain shut off itself. With this
release the bug is fixed.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<li><p>Add SecurityManager APIs for labeling network devices</p>
<p>New <span class="docutils literal">virSecurityManagerSetNetdevLabel</span> and <span class="docutils literal">virSecurityManagerSetNetdevLabel</span>
APIs are introduced and implemented in the Apparmor security driver.
The qemu driver uses the APIs to label vhostuser ports on hotplug and
restore labeling on unplug.</p>
</li>
<li><p>vmx: Parse vm.genid and support super wide SCSI bus</p>
<p>The genid attribute is now reported for VMX guests. Libvirt can now
properly process super wide SCSI bus (64 units).</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Lifecycle action (<span class="docutils literal">on_poweroff</span>/<span class="docutils literal">on_reboot</span>) handling improvements</p>
<p>The handling of lifecycle actions was fixed and improved in multiple ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">restart-rename</span></span> action was forbidden</p>
<p>The action was never properly implemented in the qemu driver and didn't
actually result in a restart of the VM but rather termination. The qemu
driver now rejects such configurations.</p>
</li>
<li><p><span class="docutils literal">preserve</span> action was forbidden</p>
<p>Similarly to the previous case this never worked as the intended semantics
of the actions dictate. It's better to not allow it at all until there's a
proper implementation</p>
</li>
<li><p><span class="docutils literal">reboot</span> action of <span class="docutils literal">on_poweroff</span> now actually works</p>
<p>The guest OS is now rebooted instead of terminating the VM when the
<span class="docutils literal">reboot</span> action is used and the guest OS powers down. Note that it's
incompatible with <span class="docutils literal">on_reboot</span> set to <span class="docutils literal">destroy</span>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Changes in action action of <span class="docutils literal">on_reboot</span> are now updated with qemu</p>
<p>Libvirtd can now properly update the <span class="docutils literal">on_reboot</span> action in qemu which
allows proper handling when changing between <span class="docutils literal">reboot</span> and <span class="docutils literal">destroy</span>
actions. In addition, switching from <span class="docutils literal">reboot</span> to <span class="docutils literal">destroy</span> was
forbidden for older qemus which don't support the update API as the guest
could still reboot and execute some instructions until it was terminated.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>virsh: Support vhostuser in attach-interface</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Bug fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>qemu: Open chardev logfile on behalf of QEMU</p>
<p>Guests with a logfile configured for their chardevs are now able to start
even when no virtlogd is configured.</p>
</li>
<li><p>virhostmem: Handle numactl-less build in hugepages allocation/reporting</p>
<p>Some architectures don't have notion of NUMA (e.g. s390x) but do support
hugepages. Libvirt silently ignored requests to allocate/report hugepage
pool when built without numactl. This is now fixed and the pool can be
allocated/reported on properly.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Record proper <span class="docutils literal">backing</span> format for overlays of qcow2+luks images</p>
<p>Libvirt would record <span class="docutils literal">luks</span> instead of <span class="docutils literal">qcow2</span> into the metadata. In
practice this is a problem only when inspecting images manually via
<span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">qemu-img</span></span> as with libvirt users must use full specification of the
backing chain in the domain XML which supersedes information recorded in
the image metadata.</p>

</li>
<li><p>qemu: Add support for launch security type s390-pv</p>
<p>Specifying s390-pv as launch security type in an s390 domain prepares for
running the guest in protected virtualization secure mode, also known as
IBM Secure Execution. This simplifies the definition and reduces the risk
of an incorrect definition, e.g. by forgetting to specify <span class="docutils literal">iommu=on</span> on
all virtio devices.</p>
</li>
<li><p>domstats: Add haltpolling time statistic interface</p>

<li><p>qemu: Fix migration with <span class="docutils literal">VIR_MIGRATE_NON_SHARED_INC</span></p>
<p>libvirt 7.3.0 introduced a bug where <span class="docutils literal">VIR_MIGRATE_NON_SHARED_INC</span> would
not actually migrate the contents of the disk due to broken logic and at

<p>When registering the threshold event with the index notation (e.g.

<p>Persistent mediated devices can now be managed with libvirt.
<span class="docutils literal">virNodeDeviceDefineXML()</span> defines a new device,
<span class="docutils literal">virNodeDeviceUndefine()</span> removes an existing definition, and
<span class="docutils literal">virNodeDeviceCreate()</span> starts a device definition that is currently

<span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">nodedev-undefine</span></span>, and <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">nodedev-start</span></span> were also added.
<span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">nodedev-list</span></span> only lists active devices by default. Inactive device

<p>Curious developers or testers now can enable certain <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-compat</span></span> modes which
allow to notice use of deprecated commands and options as qemu will use the
selected method to notify the user. The new behaviour can be requested using
either the <span class="docutils literal">deprecation_behavior</span> option in <span class="docutils literal">qemu.conf</span> for all VMs or
using <span class="docutils literal">&lt;qemu:deprecation <span class="pre">behavior='...'/&gt;</span></span> in the VM XML.</p>

</li>
<li><p><strong>Improvements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>virsh: Improve errors with <span class="docutils literal">virsh <span class="pre">snapshot-create-as</span></span></p>
<p>The XML document constructed by virsh was forced through XML schema
validation which yielded unintelligible error messages in cases such as
when the path to the new image did not start with a slash. XML documents
are no longer validated as the XML parser actually has better error
messages which allow users to figure the problem out quickly.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Terminate backing store when doing a full-chain block pull</p>
<p>When pulling everything into the overlay image the chain can be terminated
since we know that it won't depend on any backing image and thus can prevent
attempts to probe the backing chain.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Expose disk serial in virDomainGetGuestInfo()</p>
<p>The <span class="docutils literal">virDomainGetGuestInfo()</span> reports disk serial number among with other
disk information.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Bug fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>qemu: Fix crash of libvirt on full block pull of a disk</p>
<p>When the persistent definition contains a compatible disk (meaning the
definition of the running and persistent config match) a block pull job
would leave a dangling pointer in the config definition which resulted
in a crash.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Use proper job cancelling command</p>
<p>Libvirt's API contract for aborting a block copy job in 'ready' state
declares that the destination image of the copy will contain a consistent
image of the disk from the time when the block job was aborted. This
requires that libvirt uses the proper cancelling qemu command to ensure
that the data is consistent which was not the case.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Don't attempt storage migration when there are no migratable disks</p>
<p>Due to a logic bug introduced in the previous release libvirt would attempt
to migrate disks in case when no disks are selected/eligible for migration.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Fix very rare race when two block job 'ready' events are delivered</p>
<p>In certain high-load scenarios, qemu might deliver the 'ready' event twice
and if it's delivered when pivoting to the destination during a block copy
job, libvirt would get confused and execute the code as if the job were
aborted.</p>
</li>
<li><p>lxc: Fix container destroy with CGroupsV2</p>
<p>When an LXC container was started and the host used CGroupsV2 it might have
had created nested controllers under the container's scope. Libvirt was
unaware and thus destroying the container failed with a cryptic error:
<span class="docutils literal">failed to get cgroup backend for 'pathOfController'</span>. The CGroup removal
code was reworked and is now capable of dealing with such scenario.</p>
</li>
<li><p>bash-completion: Fix argument passing to $1</p>
<p>Due to a bug in bash completion script, the auto completion did not work

<li><p>qemu: Various improvements to embedded mode</p>
<p>Embedded mode for the QEMU driver, as well as the <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">virt-qemu-run</span></span> tool
saw improvements in handling of domain life cycle, temporary directories
creation (important when using disk secrets) and other minor fixes.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Documentation of split daemon related config files</p>
<p>Split daemons read configuration files upon their start. These were never
documented though.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Bug fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Check host CPU for forbidden features</p>
<p>CPU feature policy did not work as expected with <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">host-passthrough</span></span> and
features supported by physical host. CPU features were not filtered out
when <span class="docutils literal">@check</span> was set to <span class="docutils literal">full</span>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Fix virNetworkUpdate() to work with split daemons</p>
<p>Due to a bug in our code, virNetworkUpdate() did not work with split daemon
unless management application connected to virtnetworkd directly.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: increase locked memory limit when a vDPA device is present</p>
<p>Just like VFIO devices, vDPA devices may need to have all guest memory
pages locked/pinned in order to operate properly. These devices are now
included when calculating the limit for memory lock.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Don't log error if SRIOV PF has no associated netdev</p>
<p>Some SRIOV PFs don't have a netdev associated with them in which case
libvirtd reported an error and refused to start. This is now fixed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Only raise memlock limit if necessary</p>
<p>Attempting to set the memlock limit might fail if we're running
in a containerized environment where <span class="docutils literal">CAP_SYS_RESOURCE</span> is not
available, and if the limit is already high enough there's no
point in trying to raise it anyway.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Restore security context of swtpm.log</p>
<p>If a guest with emulated TPM was started and the daemon was restarted
afterwards, the security context of the per-domain <span class="docutils literal">swtpm.log</span> file was
not restored on domain shutdown leaving it unable to be started again.</p>
</li>
<li><p>virtlogd|virtlockd: Fixed crash when upgrading the daemons in-place</p>
<p>A bug preventing the in-place upgrade of <span class="docutils literal">virtlogd</span> and <span class="docutils literal">virtlockd</span>
daemons was fixed, so they can again be upgraded without dropping the log
file descriptors or locks on files.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Introduce <span class="docutils literal">&lt;boot order/&gt;</span> for <span class="docutils literal">&lt;filesystem&gt;</span></p>
<p>Booting is possible from virtiofs filesystems. Introduce an option

</li>
<li><p>hyperv: implement new APIs</p>
<p>The <span class="docutils literal">virDomainUndefine()</span>, <span class="docutils literal">virDomainUndefineFlags()</span>,

<span class="docutils literal">virNetworkGetXMLDesc()</span>, and <span class="docutils literal">virDomainScreenshot()</span>, APIs have been
implemented in the Hyper-V driver.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Support &lt;teaming&gt; element in plain &lt;hostdev&gt; devices</p>
<p>This is useful when libvirt doesn't have the privileges necessary
to set the hostdev device's MAC address (which is a necessary
part of the alternate &lt;interface type='hostdev'&gt;).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Introduce <span class="docutils literal">&lt;disk <span class="pre">type='vhostuser'&gt;</span></span> support</p>
<p>Introduces support for QEMU vhost-user-blk device that can be used
to access storage exported via the vhost-user protocol by daemons such
as the <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">qemu-storage-daemon</span></span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Bug fixes</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>qemu: Fix disk quiescing rollback when creating external snapshots</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>If the qemu guest agent call to freeze filesystems failed when creating
an external snapshot with <span class="docutils literal">VIR_DOMAIN_SNAPSHOT_CREATE_QUIESCE</span> flag the
filesystems would be unconditionally thawed. This could cause problems when
the filesystems were frozen by an explicit call to <span class="docutils literal">virDomainFSFreeze</span>
since the guest agent then rejects any further freeze attempts once are
filesystems frozen, an explicit freeze followed by a quiesced snapshot
would fail and thaw filesystems.</p>
<p>Users are also encouraged to use <span class="docutils literal">virDomainFSFreeze/Thaw</span> manually instead
of relying on <span class="docutils literal">VIR_DOMAIN_SNAPSHOT_CREATE_QUIESCE</span> if they need finer
grained control.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>cgroups: Fix how we setup and configure cgroups on hosts with systemd</p>
<p>When libvirt is running on host with systemd we register every VM with
machined which creates the VM root cgroup for us as well. Before this fix
we were directly modifying files in the VM root cgroup which was incorrect
because all the files are managed by systemd. The implication was that any
change done by libvirt to cgroup attributes supported by systemd could be
removed which happens for example by running <span class="docutils literal">systemctl <span class="pre">daemon-reload</span></span>.</p>
<p>To fix the issue libvirt now uses DBus calls for some of the cgroup
attributes that distribute the resources proportionally to the cgroup
siblings and for the rest we have a new sub-cgroup that libvirt can
managed directly.</p>
<p>For more details why this is necessary see
<a class="reference external" href="https://systemd.io/CGROUP_DELEGATION/">systemd cgroup</a> documentation.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Fix swtpm device with aarch64</p>
<p>The TPM TIS device name for x86 is <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">tpm-tis</span></span>, whereas for aarch64 it is
<span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">tpm-tis-device</span></span>. Fix the use of TPM TIS device with aarch64 by using
the proper device name when building the QEMU command line.</p>
</li>
<li><p>libxl: Fix domain shutdown</p>
<p>Commit fa30ee04a2 introduced the possibility of a race between the
shutdown and death threads used to process domain shutdown and death
events from libxl. On normal domain shutdown the shutdown thread handles
all aspects of shutting down and cleaning up the domain. The death
thread is only used to handle out-of-band domain destruction and is
inhibited when domain shutdown is under libvirt's control. The race is
avoided by also inhibiting the death thread when libvirt starts the
shutdown thread.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Project governance</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Formal handover of release tarball signing</p>
<p>Starting from libvirt-6.6 the release tarballs are signed by Jiří Denemark.
Releases starting with 7.0 contain a note from the previous maintainer
Daniel Veillard officially handing over the signing of packages so that the
transition can be verified.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>New features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>nodedev: Add node device driver support for AP devices</p>
<p>Add support for detecting and listing Adjunct Processor(AP) cards, AP
queues and AP matrix devices (which are capable of MDEV) of a KVM host
system in libvirt node device driver with correct object relationships.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Allow control of <span class="docutils literal">qcow2</span> metadata cache</p>
<p>In specific usecases such as when massive storage images are used it's
possible to achieve better performance by increasing the metadata cache
size. The new knob allows advanced users setting the size according to
qemu's documentation to suit their image.</p>
</li>
<li><p>conf: Add support for keeping TPM emulator state</p>
<p>Currently, swtpm TPM state file is removed when a transient domain is
powered off or undefined. Add per-TPM emulator option <span class="docutils literal">persistent_state</span>
for keeping TPM state.</p>
</li>
<li><p>cpu_map: Add Snowridge CPU model</p>
<p>It's supported in QEMU 4.1 and newer.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Add support for NFS disk protocol</p>
<p>Implement support for the 'nfs' native protocol driver in the qemu driver.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improvements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>qemu: Discourage users from polling <span class="docutils literal">virDomainGetBlockJobInfo</span> for block
job completion</p>
<p>Document that waiting for events is a more robust solution.</p>
</li>
<li><p>secret: Relax XML schema for the <span class="docutils literal">usage</span> name of a <span class="docutils literal">secret</span></p>
<p>Various bits of documentation of how to use libvirt with RBD volumes used
an usage name which would not pass the XML validation. Relax the requirement
to make such XMLs valid.</p>
</li>
<li><p>virnetdevopenvswitch: Various improvements</p>
<p>The code that handles <span class="docutils literal">&lt;interface <span class="pre">type='vhostuser'/&gt;</span></span> was given various
improvements. So far, libvirt assumed vhostuser interfaces are handled
exclusively by OpenVSwitch and refused to start a guest if it was not so.
Now a guest can be started successfully even if the interface is created by
some other tool (e.g. <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dpdk-testpmd</span></span>). Also, the code that detects the
interface name was adapted to new versions of OpenVSwitch and thus can
detect name more reliably.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Report guest disks information in <span class="docutils literal">virDomainGetGuestInfo</span></p>
<p>Libvirt is now able to report disks and filesystems from the guest's
perspective (using guest agent). And with sufficiently new guest agent
(5.3.0 or newer) the API also handles disks on CCW bus.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Bug fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>qemu: Fix logic bug in inactive snapshot deletion</p>
<p>This release fixes a bug introduced in libvirt-6.9 where libvirt's
snapshot metadata would not be deleted on successful snapshot deletion.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Fix VMs with <span class="docutils literal">&lt;iotune&gt;</span> on an empty cdrom</p>
<p>Specifying <span class="docutils literal">&lt;iotune&gt;</span> for an empty cdrom would prevent the VM from
starting as qemu doesn't accept the tuning for an empty drive. We now
postpone setting the parameters until a new media is inserted.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Avoid taking extra host memory when launching pSeries guests</p>
<p>Under certain conditions, pSeries guests were being launched with more
RAM than it was specified in the domain XML by the user. New pSeries
domains created with libvirt 7.0.0 will always launch with the right
amount of initial memory. Existing guests that migrate from an older
libvirt version to 7.0.0 will not be affected by this change.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Don't cache NUMA caps</p>
<p><span class="docutils literal">virsh capabilities</span> contains <span class="docutils literal">&lt;topology/&gt;</span> section which reports NUMA
topology among with amount of free hugepages per each NUMA node. However,
these amounts were not updated between calls.</p>
</li>
<li><p>networkGetDHCPLeases: Handle leases with infinite expiry time</p>
<p>Since libvirt-6.3.0 it is possible to configure expiry time for DHCP
leases. If the expiry time was infinite then <span class="docutils literal">virsh <span class="pre">net-dhcp-leases</span></span>
and NSS plugins refused to work.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Don't prealloc mem for real NVDIMMs</p>
<p>If a real life NVDIMM is assigned to a guest via <span class="docutils literal">&lt;memory <span class="pre">model='nvdimm'/&gt;</span></span>
then QEMU is no longer instructed to preallocate memory
for it. This prevents unnecessary wear on the NVDIMM.</p>
</li>
<li><p>network: Introduce mutex for bridge name generation</p>
<p>When new libvirt network is defined or created and the input XML does not
contain any bridge name, libvirt generates one. However, it might have
happened that the same name would be generated for different networks if
two or more networks were defined/created at once.</p>

</li>
<li><p>remote: <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">virt-ssh-helper</span></span> replaces <span class="docutils literal">nc</span> for SSH tunnelling</p>
<p>Libvirt now provides a <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">virt-ssh-helper</span></span> binary on the server

up an SSH tunnelled connection to hosts. If not present, it will
transparently fallback to the traditional <span class="docutils literal">nc</span> tunnel. The new

across hosts even if libvirt is built with a different installation
prefix on the client vs server. It also enables remote access to
the unprivileged per-user libvirt daemons (e.g. using a URI such as
<span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">qemu+ssh://hostname/session</span></span>). The only requirement is that
<span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">virt-ssh-helper</span></span> is present in <span class="docutils literal">$PATH</span> of the remote host.</p>
</li>
<li><p>esx: implement few APIs</p>
<p>The <span class="docutils literal">virConnectListAllNetworks()</span>, <span class="docutils literal">virDomainGetHostname()</span>, and
<span class="docutils literal">virDomainInterfaceAddresses()</span> (only for
<span class="docutils literal">VIR_DOMAIN_INTERFACE_ADDRESSES_SRC_AGENT</span> source) APIs were implemented
in the esx driver.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improvements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>qemu: Allow migration over UNIX sockets</p>
<p>QEMU migration can now be performed completely over UNIX sockets. This is
useful for containerised scenarios and can be used in both peer2peer and
direct migrations.</p>
</li>
<li><p>dbus: Use GLib implementation instead of libdbus</p>
<p>Adopting GLib DBus implementation simplifies our code as libdbus provides
low-level APIs where we had to have a lot of helper functions. With this
change we also remove dependency on libdbus and possibly fix all the DBus
related libvirtd crashes seen over the time.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Re-introduce NVDIMM auto-alignment for pSeries Guests</p>
<p>The auto-alignment logic was removed in v6.7.0 in favor of requiring the
size provided by the user to be already aligned; however, this had the
unintended consequence of breaking some existing guests. v6.8.0 restores
the previous behavior with an improvement: it also reflects the auto-aligned
value in the domain XML.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Preserve qcow2 cluster size after external snapshots</p>
<p>The new overlay image which is installed on top of the current chain when
taking an external snapshot now preserves the cluster size of the original
top image to preserve any performance tuning done on the original image.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Bug fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>qemu: Various (i)SCSI backed hostdev fixes</p>
<p>(i)SCSI backed hostdevs now work again with an arbitrarily long
user-specified device alias and also honor the 'readonly' property after a
recent rewrite.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Removed features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>node_device: Remove HAL node device backend</p>
<p>HAL is deprecated on all supported OS so there is no need to keep it
in libvirt. udev backend is used on Linux OSes and devd can be eventually
implemented as replacement for FreeBSD.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Packaging changes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Libvirt switch to Meson build system</p>
<p>Libvirt abandoned autotools and switched to Meson build system.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>New features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>qemu: Add support for initiator IQN configuration for iSCSI hostdevs</p>
<p>Similarly to iSCSI <span class="docutils literal">&lt;disk&gt;</span> users can use an <span class="docutils literal">&lt;initiator&gt;</span> element
inside <span class="docutils literal">&lt;hostdev&gt;</span> with the same format to configure the <span class="docutils literal">IQN</span> value
used by the qemu initiator when connecting to an iSCSI target.</p>
</li>
<li><p>xen: Add support for device model command-line passthrough</p>
<p>Xen supports passing arbitrary arguments to the QEMU device model using
the <span class="docutils literal">device_model_args</span> setting in xl.cfg(5). The libvirt xen driver now
supports this using <span class="docutils literal">&lt;xen:commandline/&gt;</span> XML extensions.</p>
</li>
<li><p>shmem: Add support for shmem-{plain, doorbell} <span class="docutils literal">role</span> option</p>
<p>The <span class="docutils literal">role</span> attribute controls how the domain behaves on migration. With
<span class="docutils literal">role=master</span>, the guest will copy the shared memory on migration to
the destination host. With <span class="docutils literal">role=peer</span>, the migration is disabled.</p>
</li>
<li><p>bhyve: Sound device support</p>
<p>This feature allows to configure guest sound device using
the <span class="docutils literal">&lt;sound&gt;</span> element, and map it to the host sound device using
the <span class="docutils literal">&lt;audio&gt;</span> element.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improvements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Allow sparse streams for block devices</p>
<p>Sparse streams (e.g. <span class="docutils literal">virsh <span class="pre">vol-download</span> <span class="pre">--sparse</span></span> or <span class="docutils literal">virsh <span class="pre">vol-upload</span> <span class="pre">--sparse</span></span>) now handle if one of the stream ends is a block device.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Remove NVDIMM auto-alignment for pSeries Guests</p>
<p>This feature was introduced in libvirt v6.2.0 as part of the overall
NVDIMM support for pSeries guests. The idea was to relieve the user
from knowing ppc64 alignment details, but the end result is that we
ended up with inconsistencies between domain XML and actual NVDIMM
size the guest is using. To promote consistency between domain XML
and the guest, unaligned NVDIMM sizes for pSeries guests will now be
forbidden and no size auto-alignment will be made. Instead, libvirt will
suggest an aligned round up size for the user.</p>
</li>
<li><p>apparmor: Several improvements</p>
<p>Add support for virtiofs filesystem and allow QEMU to load old
shared objects after upgrade.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Bug fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>virdevmapper: Deal with kernels without DM support</p>
<p>In the previous release libvirt dropped libdevmapper in favor of its own
implementation. However, it failed to deal correctly with kernels that
either don't have device mapper enabled or where the dm-mod module is not
loaded yet. This is now fixed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>resctrl: Use exclusive lock for /sys/fs/resctrl</p>
<p>When two or more domains were attempted to start at once, due to a bug in
implementation, resctrl was not locked properly and thus threads did not
mutually exclude with each other resulting in not setting requested
limitations.</p>
</li>
<li><p>mdev: Fix daemon crash when reattaching mdevs on assignment conflict</p>
<p>If there's a list of mdevs to be assigned to a domain, but one of them (NOT
the first) is already assigned to a different domain then libvirtd would
crash. This is now fixed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Fix logic in setting COW flag on btrfs</p>
<p>When COW is not explicitly requested to be disabled or enabled, then
libvirt should do nothing on non-BTRFS file systems.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Avoid crash due to race in glib event loop code</p>
<p>Libvirt switched to glib event loop in 6.1.0 but it was also tickling a bug
in glib code leading to the daemon crash. Libvirt way of calling glib was
changed so the daemon crashes no more.</p>
</li>
<li><p>virdevmapper: Handle kernel without device-mapper support</p>
<p>In the previous release, Libvirt dropped libdevmapper in favor of its own
implementation. But the implementation did not handle kernels without
device-mapper support. This is now fixed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>remove autogenerated macvtap names from migration XML</p>
<p>Autogenerated macvtap device names were being left in the
migration XML, which could result in libvirt erroneously deleting
the macvtap device of a different guest in the aftermath of
failing to restart the guest on the destination host. Removing the
autogenerated names avoids this.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>New features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Allow configuring of ACPI NUMA HMAT</p>
<p>Libvirt allows configuring ACPI Heterogeneous Memory Attribute Table to
hint software running inside the guest on optimization.</p>
</li>
<li><p>esx: Add a <span class="docutils literal">type</span> attribute for mac addresses.</p>
<p>This attribute allows (when set to <span class="docutils literal">static</span>) ignoring VMWare checks of the
MAC addresses that would generate a new one if they were in its OUI
(00:0c:29).</p>
</li>
<li><p>conf: add control over COW for storage pool directories</p>
<p>The storage pool code now attempts to disable COW by default on btrfs, but
management applications may wish to override this behaviour. This is now
possible via new <span class="docutils literal">cow</span> element.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improvements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>esx: Change the NIC limit for recent virtualHW versions</p>
<p>Specifying a virtualHW version greater or equal to 7 (ESXi 4.0) will allow
you to use up to 10 NICs instead of 4 as it was previously.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Support encrypted TLS keys for NBD disks</p>
<p>The secret key used for disks can now be encrypted similarly to TLS keys
used for migration, chardev and others.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: <span class="docutils literal">VIR_DOMAIN_EVENT_ID_BLOCK_THRESHOLD</span> can now be registered for <span class="docutils literal">&lt;mirror&gt;</span></p>
<p>The event can now be used also for block copy destinations by using the
index of the <span class="docutils literal">&lt;mirror&gt;</span> image.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: consider available CPUs in <span class="docutils literal">vcpupin/emulatorpin</span> output</p>
<p>This patch changes the default bitmap of <span class="docutils literal">vcpupin</span> and <span class="docutils literal">emulatorpin</span>,
in the case of domains with static vcpu placement, all available CPUs
instead of all possible CPUs are returned making these APIs consistent with
the behavior of <span class="docutils literal">vcpuinfo</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Bug fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>virdevmapper: Don't use libdevmapper to obtain dependencies</p>
<p>When building domain's private <span class="docutils literal">/dev</span> in a namespace, libdevmapper was
consulted for getting full dependency tree of domain's disks. However, this
meant that libdevmapper opened <span class="docutils literal">/dev/mapper/control</span> which wasn't closed
and was leaked to QEMU. CVE-2020-14339</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Report correct <span class="docutils literal">index</span> in <span class="docutils literal">VIR_DOMAIN_EVENT_ID_BLOCK_THRESHOLD</span></p>
<p>Starting from libvirt 5.10 with QEMU 4.2 the
<span class="docutils literal">VIR_DOMAIN_EVENT_ID_BLOCK_THRESHOLD</span> event would report incorrect device
<span class="docutils literal">index</span> when reported for an image from the backing chain of a disk.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Don't fail active layer block commit or block copy in certain cases</p>
<p>Starting from libvirt-6.5 an active layer block commit or a block copy could
fail if the same destination was used more than once.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Don't change ownership of restore file</p>
<p>When restoring a domain from a file, Libvirt no longer changes its ownership.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Set SPAPR TPM default to 2.0 and prevent 1.2 choice</p>
<p>The firmware (SLOF) on QEMU for ppc64 does not support TPM 1.2, so prevent
the choice of TPM 1.2 when the SPAPR device model is chosen and use a
default of '2.0' (TPM 2) for the backend.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Do not set <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">//cpu/@migratable</span></span> for running domains</p>
<p>Libvirt release of 6.4.0 started to fill the default value for
<span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">//cpu/@migratable</span></span> attribute according to QEMU support. However, active
domains either have the migratable attribute already set or they were
started with older Libvirt which doesn't support the attribute.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>New features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Allow firmware blobs configuration</p>
<p>QEMU offers a way to tweak how firmware configures itself
and/or provide new configuration blobs. New <span class="docutils literal">&lt;sysinfo/&gt;</span>
type is introduced that will hold these new blobs.
It's possible to either specify new value as a string or
provide a filename which contents then serve as the value.</p>
</li>
<li><p>nodedev: Add ability to create mediated devices</p>
<p>Mediated devices can now be created with <span class="docutils literal">virNodeDeviceCreateXML()</span>. This
functionality requires the <span class="docutils literal">mdevctl</span> utility to be installed. The XML
schema for node devices was expanded to support attributes for mediated
devices.</p>
</li>
<li><p>QEMU: add TPM Proxy device support</p>
<p>libvirt can now create guests using a new device type called
"TPM Proxy". The TPM Proxy connects to a TPM Resource Manager
present in the host, enabling the guest to run in secure virtual
machine mode with the help of an Ultravisor. Adding a TPM Proxy to
a pSeries guest brings no security benefits unless the guest is
running on a PPC64 host that has Ultravisor and TPM Resource Manager
support. Only one TPM Proxy is allowed per guest. A guest using
a TPM Proxy device can instantiate another TPM device at the same
time. This device is supported only for pSeries guests via the new
'spapr-tpm-proxy' model of the TPM 'passthrough' backend.</p>
</li>
<li><p>virhook: Support hooks placed in several files</p>
<p>Running all scripts from directory /etc/libvirt/hooks/&lt;driver&gt;.d in
alphabetical order. Hook script in old place will be executed
as first for backward compatibility.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Add support for migratable host-passthrough CPU</p>
<p>QEMU 2.12 made it possible for guests to use a migration-friendly
version of the host-passthrough CPU. This feature is now exposed by
libvirt.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improvements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>network: Support NAT with IPv6</p>
<p>It's now possible to use <span class="docutils literal">&lt;nat <span class="pre">ipv6="yes"/&gt;</span></span> in a libvirt network.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Auto-fill NUMA information for incomplete topologies</p>
<p>If the NUMA topology is not fully described in the guest XML, libvirt
will complete it by putting all unspecified CPUs in the first NUMA node.
This is only done in the QEMU binary itself supports disjointed CPU
ranges for NUMA nodes.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Assign hostdev-backed interfaces to PCIe slots</p>
<p>All SR-IOV capable devices are PCIe, so when their VFs are assigned to
guests they should end up in PCIe slots rather than conventional PCI ones.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Bug fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>qemu: fixed crash in <span class="docutils literal">qemuDomainBlockCommit</span></p>
<p>This release fixes a regression which was introduced in libvirt v6.4.0
where libvirtd always crashes when a block commit of a disk is requested.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: fixed zPCI address auto generation on s390</p>
<p>Removes the correlation between the zPCI address attributes uid and fid.
Fixes the validation and autogeneration of zPCI address attributes.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Skip pre-creation of NVMe disks during migration</p>
<p>libvirt has no way to create NVMe devices on the target host, so it now
just makes sure they exist and let the migration proceed in that case.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>New features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>qemu: Add support for pvscsi controllers</p>
<p>pvscsi is the VMware paravirtualized SCSI controller, which has been
supported in QEMU for a number of years.</p>
</li>

</li>
<li><p>qemu: support network interface downscript</p>
<p>QEMU has the ability to run a script when a NIC is brought up and down.
Libvirt only enables use of the up script. Now add support for postscript
when NIC is down/detached.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improvements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>qemu: stricter validation for disk type='lun'</p>
<p>The 'lun' type is meant for SCSI command passthrough, which can't be
achieved if qemu's block layer features are used. Disk type='lun' is now
allowed only when the format is 'raw' and no other block layer features are
requested.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: auto-fill of incomplete NUMA topologies</p>
<p>Domains with incomplete NUMA topologies, where the sum of vCPUs in all NUMA
cells is less than the total of vCPUs, will get their first NUMA cell to
be auto-filled with the remaining vCPUs. This behavior reproduces what QEMU
already does in these cases. Users are encouraged to provide complete NUMA
topologies to avoid unexpected changes in the domain XML.</p>

<li><p>Cooperlake x86 CPU model is added</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Bug fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>qemu: fixed regression in network device hotplug with new qemu versions</p>
<p>Starting from QEMU-5.0 it's required to conform to strict schema when
hotplugging network devices. Libvirt didn't conform to the schema so in
versions prior to 6.4.0 network device hotplug fails in certain cases. This
version fixes it and adds stricter testing to prevent further issues.</p>
</li>
<li><p>remote: Look up libxl driver correctly</p>
<p>This makes <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">xen://</span></span> connection URIs usable in split daemon mode.</p>
</li>
<li><p>systemd: Start libvirtd after firewalld/iptables services</p>
<p>This solves an issue where iptables rules and chains created by libvirtd
would get removed by a service started after it.</p>
</li>

<p>firewalld resets all iptables rules and chains on restart, and this
includes deleting those created by libvirt.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>New features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>qemu: support disabling hotplug/unplug of PCIe devices</p>
<p>libvirt can now set the "hotplug" option for pcie-root-ports and
pcie-switch-downstream-ports, which can be used to disable hotplug/unplug
of devices from these ports (default behavior is for these controllers to
accept all hotplug/unplug attempts, but this is often undesirable).</p>
</li>
<li><p>vbox: added support for version 6.0 and 6.1 APIs</p>
<p>libvirt can now support use of the VirtualBox 6.0 and 6.1 APIs. This is
compile tested only, so we are looking for feedback from users on how well
it works in practice.</p>
</li>
<li><p>xen: Add support for 'e820_host' hypervisor feature</p>
<p><span class="docutils literal">e820_host</span> is a Xen-specific option only available for PV guests. When
enabled it provides the guest with a virtual e820 memory map based on the
host one. It must be enabled to allow hotplugging PCI devices to PV guests,
particularly when memory ballooning is enabled.</p>
</li>
<li><p>xen: Add support for 'passthrough' hypervisor feature</p>
<p><span class="docutils literal">passthrough</span> is a Xen-specific option new to Xen 4.13 that enables PCI
passthrough for guests. It must be enabled to allow hotplugging PCI
devices.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: support async IO mode 'io_uring'</p>
<p>Linux 5.1 introduces a fast and efficient async IO interface io_uring, then
qemu implements that in version 5.0. It could be used in file, host device
and host cdrom backend by <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">io='io_uring'</span></span> of disk XML.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Lease time option included for network DHCP settings</p>
<p>Users can now configure expiry time for leases for networks where libvirt
manages DHCP. The time can be specified for whole range and/or fine tuned
per individual host.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Implement pSeries Spectre mitigation features</p>
<p>Users can now setup the following capabilities of pSeries guests: CFPC
(Cache Flush on Privilege Change), SBBC (Speculation Barrier Bounds
Checking) and IBS (Indirect Branch Speculation).</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Add support for virtio packed option</p>
<p>The <span class="docutils literal">packed</span> attribute controls if QEMU should try to use packed
virtqueues. Possible values are <span class="docutils literal">on</span> or <span class="docutils literal">off</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improvements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>qemu: Allow checkpoint redefine for offline VMs</p>
<p>Skip the liveness and capability checks when redefining checkpoints as we
don't need QEMU interactions to update the metadata.</p>
</li>
<li><p>daemons: Improve timeout handling</p>
<p>Daemons now support <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--timeout</span> 0</span> which suppresses daemon killing after
given time of inactivity.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Add support for 'multidevs' option</p>
<p>This option prevents misbehaviours on guest if a QEMU 9pfs export contains
multiple devices, due to the potential file ID collisions this otherwise
may cause.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Bug fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>qemu: Various embed driver fixes</p>
<p>When using shared resources from embed driver (e.g. hugepages, machined,
etc.) libvirt now generates an unique handler that is not conflicting with
other embed drivers or system or session daemons.</p>
</li>
<li><p>cpu: Distinguish Cascadelake-Server from Skylake-Server</p>
<p>Libvirt now properly detects Cascadelake-Server and Skylake-Server
processors which differ only in stepping.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Fix domain restore from a block device</p>
<p>When using namespaces, libvirt was unable to restore a domain from a block
device because libvirt tried to relabel the device inside the namespace
while QEMU was given FD to the block device in the host.</p>
</li>
<li><p>node_device_udev: Handle move events</p>
<p>Libvirt now handles <span class="docutils literal">move</span> event which is emitted on a NIC rename.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Fix capabilities probing with TCG</p>
<p>Libvirt no long assumes TCG is always available. It now detects whether
QEMU supports TCG and reports it accordingly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Removed features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>vbox: removed support for version 5.0 and 5.1 APIs</p>
<p>libvirt no longer supports use of VirtualBox 5.0 and 5.1 since these
versions reached their end of life on 2017/05 and 2018/04 respectively.</p>

<li><p>qemu: NVDIMM support for pSeries guests</p>
<p>QEMU 5.0 implements NVDIMM memory support for pSeries guests. This is done
by adding an 'uuid' element in the memory XML, which can either be provided

as expected when multiple libvirtd instances were running on the same host
but in different containers. With this release, the host UUID (which should
be unique to the container) is checked instead.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Use per-VM event loops</p>
<p>Instead of using a single even loop to process communication with the QEMU
monitor and guest agent, create a separate one for each VM. This helps with
scalability and prevents scenarios where a single malfunctioning VM could
affect all those running on the same host.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Support migration with SLIRP helper interface</p>
<p>With QEMU 5.0, a new D-Bus backend allows migration of external processes.
When needed, libvirt will start a per-vm D-Bus bus, and migrate the
slirp-helper along with QEMU.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Bug fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>qemu: Open backing chain late for shallow block copy reusing external
images</p>
<p>With introduction of -blockdev for QEMU storage configuration in
libvirt-5.10 we've started opening the backing chain of the
destination/mirror of a virDomainBlockcopy started with
VIR_DOMAIN_BLOCK_COPY_REUSE_EXT | VIR_DOMAIN_BLOCK_COPY_SHALLOW flags when
starting the job rather than when virDomainBlockJobAbort with
VIR_DOMAIN_BLOCK_JOB_ABORT_PIVOT is issued. For users depending on this
undocumented quirky pre-blockdev behaviour this caused a regression as the
backing chain could not be modified while the copy of the top image was
progressing due to QEMU image locking. Note that this fix also requires
qemu-5.0 while -blockdev is used starting from QEMU-4.2.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Don't generate machine names containing dots</p>
<p>Even though the guest name containing dots is not a problem for libvirt
itself, we need to strip them out when registering with machined because of
the latter's requirements.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h1>v6.1.0 (2020-03-03)<a class="headerlink" href="#v6-1-0-2020-03-03" title="Link to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>New features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>qemu: new rng backend type: builtin</p>
<p>It implements qemu builtin rng backend. That uses getrandom syscall to
generate random, no external rng source needed. Available since QEMU 4.2.</p>
</li>
<li><p>support for virtio+hostdev NIC &lt;teaming&gt;</p>
<p>QEMU 4.2.0 and later, combined with a sufficiently recent guest virtio-net
driver (e.g. the driver included in Linux kernel 4.18 and later), supports
setting up a simple network bond device comprised of one virtio emulated
NIC and one hostdev NIC (which must be an SRIOV VF). (in QEMU, this is
known as the "virtio failover" feature). The allure of this setup is that
the bond will always favor the hostdev device, providing better
performance, until the guest is migrated - at that time QEMU will
automatically unplug the hostdev NIC and the bond will send all traffic via
the virtio NIC until migration is completed, then QEMU on the destination
side will hotplug a new hostdev NIC and the bond will switch back to using
the hostdev for network traffic. The result is that guests desiring the
extra performance of a hostdev NIC are now migratable without network
downtime (performance is just degraded during migration) and without
requiring a complicated bonding configuration in the guest OS network
config and complicated unplug/replug logic in the management application on
the host - it can instead all be accomplished in libvirt with the interface
&lt;teaming&gt; subelement "type" and "persistent" attributes.</p>
</li>
<li><p>support BR_ISOLATED flag for guest interfaces attached to a Linux host
bridge</p>
<p>Since Linux kernel 4.18, the Linux host bridge has had a flag BR_ISOLATED
that can be applied to individual ports. When this flag is set for a port,
traffic is blocked between that port and any other port that also has the
BR_ISOLATED flag set. libvirt domain interface config now supports setting
this flag via the &lt;port isolated='yes'/&gt; setting. It can also be set for
all connections to a particular libvirt network by setting the same option
in the network config - since the port for the host itself does not have
BR_ISOLATED set, the guests can communicate with the host and the outside
world, but guests on that network can't communicate with each other. This
feature works for QEMU and LXC guests with interfaces attached to a Linux
host bridge.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Introduce the 'armvtimer' timer type</p>
<p>QEMU 5.0 introduces the ability to control the behavior of the virtual
timer for KVM ARM/virt guests, and this new timer type exposes the same
capability to libvirt users.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Storage configuration improvements</p>
<p>Libvirt now accepts <span class="docutils literal">&lt;backingStore <span class="pre">type='volume'&gt;</span></span> and allows specifying
the offset and size of the image format container inside the storage source
via the <span class="docutils literal">&lt;slices&gt;</span> subelement.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Introduce the 'tpm-spapr' TPM model</p>
<p>This device, available starting from QEMU 5.0, is limited to pSeries
guests.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: support Panic Crashloaded event handling</p>
<p>The pvpanic device now supports a 'crashloaded' event, which is emitted
when a guest panic has occurred but has already been handled by the guest
itself.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Implement virDomainGetHostnameFlags</p>
<p>The <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--source</span></span> argument to <span class="docutils literal">virsh domhostname</span> can be used to specify
what data source to use for the domain hostnames. Currently, in addition
to the 'agent', libvirt can also use 'lease' information from dnsmasq to
get the hostname.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improvements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>qemu: Image format probing is allowed in certain cases</p>
<p>To resolve regressions when users didn't specify the backing image format
in the overlay, libvirt now probes the format in certain secure scenarios
which fixes a few common existing cases. Additionally the knowledge base
was extended to provide more information on how to rectify the problem.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Support "dies" in CPU topology</p>
<p>This CPU topology concept, new in QEMU 4.1.0, sits between the existing
"socket" and "core".</p>
</li>
<li><p>libxl: Add support for Credit2 scheduler parameters</p></li>
<li><p>lxc: Add support LXC 3 network configuration format</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Bug fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>conf: Do not generate machine names ending with a dash</p>
<p>Recent systemd versions do not allow them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Packaging changes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>use of gnulib has been completely eliminated</p>
<p>Historically libvirt has embedded gnulib to provide fixes for various
platform portability problems. This usage has now been eliminated and
alternative approaches for platform portability problems adopted where
required. This has been validated on the set of platforms covered by
automated CI build testing. Other modern Linux distros using glibc are
expected to work. Linux distros using non-glibc packages, and other
non-Linux platforms may encounter regressions when building this release.
Please report any build problems encountered back to the project
maintainers for evaluation.</p>

<h1>v6.0.0 (2020-01-15)<a class="headerlink" href="#v6-0-0-2020-01-15" title="Link to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Packaging changes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>support for python2 is removed</p>
<p>Libvirt is no longer able to be built using the Python 2 binary. Python 3
must be used instead.</p>
</li>
<li><p>docs: the python docutils toolset is now required</p>
<p>The use of rst2html has been introduced for the website build process since
docs are now being written in the RST as an alternative to HTML.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>New features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>new PCI hostdev address type: unassigned</p>
<p>A new PCI hostdev address type 'unassigned' is introduced. An unassigned
PCI hostdev behaves like any regular PCI hostdev inside Libvirt, but it is
not usable by the guest. This gives the user a new option to manage the
binding of PCI devices via Libvirt, declaring PCI hostdevs in the domain
XML but allowing just a subset of them to be assigned to the guest.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Provide init scripts for sub-deaemons</p>
<p>So far libvirt shipped systemd unit files for sub-daemons. With this
release, init scripts are available too. Package maintainers can choose
which one to install via <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--with-init-script</span></span> configure option.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Support cold-unplug of sound devices</p></li>
<li><p>qemu: Implement VIR_MIGRATE_PARAM_TLS_DESTINATION</p>
<p>This flag, which can be enabled using <span class="docutils literal">virsh</span> 's <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--tls-destination</span></span>
option, allows migration to succeed in situations where there is a mismatch
between the destination's hostname and the information stored in its TLS
certificate.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Support reporting memory bandwidth usage stats</p>
<p>Implement Intel RDT-MBM in libvirt. The stats can be obtained via <span class="docutils literal">virsh domstats <span class="pre">--memory</span></span> .</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Allow accessing NVMe disks directly</p>
<p>Before this release there were two ways to configure a NVMe disk for a
domain. The first was using &lt;disk/&gt; with the &lt;source/&gt; pointing to the
<span class="docutils literal">/dev/nvmeXXXX</span> . The other was using PCI assignment via &lt;hostdev/&gt;
element. Both have their disadvantages: the former adds latency of file
system and block layers of the host kernel, the latter prohibits domain
migration. In this release the third way of configuring NVMe disk is added
which combines the advantages and drops disadvantages of the previous two
ways. It's accessible via &lt;disk type='nvme'/&gt;.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Removed features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>'phyp' Power Hypervisor driver removed</p>
<p>The 'phyp' Power Hypervisor driver has not seen active development since
2011 and does not seem to have any real world usage. It has now been
removed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improvements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>qemu: xz save image compression is faster</p>
<p>When using the xz format to compressed virtual machine saved state images,
the "-3" compression level preset is now used. This results in slightly
larger files, but with a massively reduced time to compress. The xz format
offers the best compression level for saved state images, albeit still with
the slowest running time. For the fastest possible running time, at cost of
the larest compressed size, lzop should be used.</p>
</li>
<li><p>domain: Improve job stat handling</p>
<p>It is now possible to retrieve stats for completed and failed jobs.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Don't hold monitor and agent job at the same time</p>
<p>Before this change, a malicious (or buggy) <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">qemu-guest-agent</span></span> running in
the guest could make other libvirt APIs unavailable for an unbounded amount
of time.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Bug fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>qemu: Report error if backing image format is not specified explicitly</p>
<p>For a long time libvirt was assuming that a backing file is RAW when the
format was not specified. This didn't pose a problem until blockdev support
was enabled in last release. Libvirt now requires that the format is
specified in the image metadata or domain XML and the VM will refuse to
start otherwise. Additionally the error message now links to the knowledge
base which summarizes how to fix the images.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Fix non-shared storage migration over NBD</p></li>
<li><p>qemu: Generate a single MAC address for hotplugged network devices</p>
<p>Since libvirt 4.6.0, when hotplugging a network device that didn't have a
MAC address already assigned by the user, two separate addresses would be
generated: one for the live configuration, which would show up immediately,
and one for the inactive configuration, which would show up after the first
reboot. This situation was clearly undesirable, so a single MAC address is
now generated and used both for the live configuration and the inactive
one.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>New features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>qemu: Introduce support for ARM CPU features</p>
<p>The only features supported at the moment are SVE vector lengths, which
were introduced in QEMU 4.2.0.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Support boot display for GPU mediated devices</p>
<p>Until now, GPU mediated devices generally did not show any output until the
guest OS had initialized the vGPU. By specifying the <span class="docutils literal">ramfb</span> attribute,
QEMU can be configured to use ramfb as a boot display for the device: this
allows for display of firmware messages, boot loader menu, and other output
before the guest OS has initialized the vGPU.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Add API to change the response timeout for guest agent commands</p>
<p>By default, when a command is sent to the guest agent, libvirt waits
forever for a response from the guest agent. If the guest is unresponsive
for any reason, this can block the calling thread indefinitely. By setting
a custom timeout using <span class="docutils literal">virDomainAgentSetResponseTimeout()</span> , API users
can change this behavior.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improvements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Devices CGroup v2 support</p>
<p>Libvirt supported all controllers of CGroup v2 but the devices controller
which is implemented in this release.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Cold plug of sound device</p>
<p>The QEMU driver now can handle cold plug of <span class="docutils literal">&lt;sound/&gt;</span> devices.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Probe for default CPU types</p>
<p>With QEMU 4.2.0 we can probe for the default CPU model used by QEMU for a
particular machine type and store it in the domain XML. This way the chosen
CPU model is more visible to users and libvirt will make sure the guest
will see the exact same CPU after migration.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Adaptation to qemu's blockdev</p>
<p>QEMU introduced a new way of specifying disks on the command line which
enables fine-grained control over the block stack. Libvirt has adapted to
this.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Refactors</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>More GLib integration</p>
<p>More patches were merged that replace our internal functions with GLib
ones. Also some effort was invested in replacing gnulib modules with GLib
functions.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Rewrite of Perl scripts into Python</p>
<p>Libvirt used Perl scripts to check for coding style, generate some code and
things like that. To bring the number of languages used down, these scripts
were rewritten into Python.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Bug fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Warn verbosely if using old loader:nvram pairs</p>
<p>Some distributions still use <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--with-loader-nvram</span></span> or <span class="docutils literal">nvram</span> variable
in qemu.conf. This is now discouraged in favour of FW descriptors. However,
instead of silently ignoring user's config, libvirt warns if outdated
config is detected.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Drop pconfig from Icelake-Server CPU model</p>
<p>The pconfig feature was enabled in QEMU by accident in 3.1.0. All other
newer versions do not support it and it was removed from the Icelake-Server
CPU model in QEMU.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Wait longer for device removal confirmation on PPC64</p>
<p>After sending device hot unplug request to QEMU, libvirt waits up to 5
seconds for qemu to confirm the device removal. On some architectures (like
PPC64) this can take longer time and libvirt now reflects that.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Forcibly create nodes in domain's namespace</p>
<p>The QEMU driver starts a domain in a namespace with private <span class="docutils literal">/dev</span> and
creates only those nodes there which the domain is configured to have.
However, it may have happened that if a node changed its minor number this
change wasn't propagated to the namespace.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Various AppArmor bugfixes</p>
<p>The AppArmor driver now knows how to handle <span class="docutils literal">&lt;shmem/&gt;</span> devices and also
snapshotting more disks at once.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Improved video model autoselection</p>
<p>If a graphics device was added to XML that had no video device, libvirt
automatically added a video device which was always of type 'cirrus' on
x86_64, even if the underlying qemu didn't support cirrus. Libvirt now
bases the decision on qemu's capabilities.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Packaging changes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Start linking against GLib and using its features</p>
<p>Up until now, libvirt has been dealing with platform portability and the
lack of certain features in libc by using gnulib and implementing its own
functions and data structures respectively; going forward, it will prefer
the facilities offered by GLib instead.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Stop distributing generated documentation</p>
<p>Most downstreams already patch the libvirt source to some extent, so this
change will probably not affect them.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Rewrite several Perl scripts in Python</p>
<p>Phasing out Perl usage is part of the project strategy.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>New features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>qemu: Introduce a new video model of type 'ramfb'</p>
<p>Introduce a new video model type to the domain XML that supports the
<span class="docutils literal">ramfb</span> standalone device in qemu.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Implement the ccf-assist pSeries feature</p>
<p>Users can now decide whether ccf-assist (Count Cache Flush Assist) support
should be available to pSeries guests.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Xen: Support specifying ACPI firmware path</p>
<p>The libxl driver now supports specifying an ACPI firmware path using the
<span class="docutils literal">acpi</span> element.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Support specifying resolution for video devices</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Removed features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>logging: Drop support for including stack traces</p>
<p>This feature was intended to aid debugging, but in practice it resulted in
logs that were too verbose to be useful and also resulted in a significant
performance penalty.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improvements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>qemu: Implement CPU comparison/baseline on s390x</p>
<p>This functionality has been historically limited to x86_64, but it's now
available on s390x too.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Bug fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>lib: autostart objects exactly once</p>
<p>If libvirtd or any of the sub-daemons is started with socket activation
then objects might be autostarted more than once. For instance, if a domain
under <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">qemu:///session</span></span> URI is mark as autostarted and the session daemon
is started then the domain is started with it. If user shuts the domain
down and the session daemon is started again, the user's wish to keep the
domain shut off is ignored and the domain is autostarted again. This is now
fixed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Properly advertise bochs-display availability</p>
<p>Support for <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">bochs-display</span></span> was introduced in libvirt 5.6.0, but until
now the model was not listed in the domain capabilities.</p>
</li>
<li><p>security: Don't remember labels for TPM devices</p>
<p>Due to the way they're implemented in the kernel, trying to remember labels
for TPM devices makes it impossible to use them.</p>
</li>
<li><p>security: Properly rollback after failure in a stacked driver</p>
<p>When multiple security drivers are involved, failure in one of them would
result in only the corresponding changes being rolled back, leaving the
ones performed by drivers that had been activated earlier in place. All
changes are rolled back now.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Stop linking NSS plugins with libvirt.so</p>
<p>This reduces the amount of code and 3rd party libraries are that loaded

trusted virt-login-shell-helper binary.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Allow migration with disk cache on</p>
<p>When QEMU supports flushing caches at the end of migration, we can safely
allow migration even if <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">disk/driver/@cache</span></span> is neither <span class="docutils literal">none</span> nor
<span class="docutils literal">directsync</span> .</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Bug fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Various security label remembering fixes</p>
<p>In the previous release libvirt introduced remembering of original owners
and SELinux labels on files. However, the feature did not work properly
with snapshots, on migrations or on network filesystems. This is now fixed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Allow greater PCI domain numbers</p>
<p>Libvirt used to require PCI domain number to be not greater than 0xFFFF.
The code was changed to allow 32 bits long numbers.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Various D-Bus fixes</p>
<p>When D-Bus is not available, libvirt was reporting random errors. These are
now gone.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Prefer read-only opening of PCI config files</p>
<p>When enumerating PCI bus, libvirt opens config files under <span class="docutils literal">sysfs</span> mount
and parses them to learn various aspects of the device (e.g. its
capabilities). Only in a very limited number of cases it is actually
writing into the file. However, it used to open the file also for writing
even if it was only reading from it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Fix AppArmor profile</p>
<p>Since the <span class="docutils literal">5.6.0</span> release, libvirt uses <span class="docutils literal">procfs</span> to learn the list of
opened file descriptors when spawning a command. However, our AppArmor
profile was not allowing such access.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Don't block storage driver when starting or building a pool</p>
<p>Starting or building a storage pool can take a long time to finish. During
this time the storage driver was blocked and thus no other API involving
the storage driver could run. This is now fixed.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>New features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>qemu: Introduce a new video model of type 'bochs'</p>
<p>Introduce a new video model type that supports the <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">bochs-display</span></span> device
that was added in qemu version 3.0.</p>
</li>
<li><p>api: new virDomainCheckpoint APIs</p>
<p>Introduce several new APIs for creating and managing checkpoints in the
test and qemu drivers (the latter requires qcow2 images). Checkpoints serve
as a way to tell which portions of a disk have changed since a point in
time.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Add support for overriding max threads per process limit</p>
<p>systemd-based systems impose a limit on the number of threads a process can
spawn, which in some cases can be exceeded by QEMU processes running VMs.
Add a <span class="docutils literal">max_threads_per_process</span> option to qemu.conf to override the
system default.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Remember original owners and SELinux labels of files</p>
<p>When a domain is starting up libvirt changes DAC and SELinux labels so that
domain can access it. However, it never remembered the original labels and
therefore the file was returned back to <span class="docutils literal">root:root</span> . With this release,
the original labels are remembered and restored properly.</p>
</li>
<li><p>network: Allow passing arbitrary options to dnsmasq</p>
<p>This works similarly to the existing support for passing arbitrary options
to QEMU, and just like that feature it comes with no support guarantees.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Removed features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>xen: Remove sxpr config support</p>
<p>Remove the sxpr style config parser and formatter a year after the xend
driver was removed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improvements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>qemu: Allow XML validation for snapshot creation</p>
<p>Add flag <span class="docutils literal">VIR_DOMAIN_SNAPSHOT_CREATE_VALIDATE</span> to validate snapshot input
XML. For virsh, users can use it as <span class="docutils literal">virsh <span class="pre">snapshot-create</span> <span class="pre">--validate</span></span> .</p>
</li>
<li><p>Support encrypted soft TPM</p>
<p>A soft TPM backend could be encrypted with passphrase. Now libvirt supports
using a <span class="docutils literal">secret</span> object to hold the passphrase, and referring to it via
the <span class="docutils literal">encryption</span> element of the TPM device.</p>
</li>
<li><p>test driver: Expand API coverage</p>
<p>Additional APIs have been implemented in the test driver.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Implement per-driver locking</p>
<p>Drivers now acquire a lock when they're loaded, ensuring that there can
never be two instances of the same driver active at a time.</p>
</li>
<li><p>nss: Report newer addresses first</p>
<p>In some cases, a guest might be assigned a new IP address by DHCP before
the previous lease has expired, in which case the NSS plugin will correctly
report both addresses; many applications, however, ignore all addresses but
the first, and may thus end up trying to connect using a stale address. To
prevent that from happening, the NSS plugin will now always report the
newest address first.</p>
</li>
<li><p>util: Optimize mass closing of FDs when spawning child processes</p>
<p>When the limit on the number of FDs is very high, closing all unwanted FDs
after calling <span class="docutils literal">fork()</span> can take a lot of time and delay the start of the
child process. libvirt will now use an optimized algorithm that minimizes
such delays.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Bug fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>logging: Ensure virtlogd rollover takes priority over logrotate</p>
<p>virtlogd implements its own rollover mechanism, but until now logrotate
could end up acting on the logs before virtlogd had a chance to do so
itself.</p>

did not work with modern QEMU command lines, generated from libvirt or
otherwise.</p>

<li><p>sysinfo: Report SMBIOS information on aarch64</p>
<p>While SMBIOS support has historically been limited to x86_64, modern

<li><p>virt-xml-validate: Allow input to be read from stdin</p></li>
<li><p>qemu: Validate spapr-vio addresses as 32-bit</p>
<p>libvirt has always considered these addresses (used for pSeries guests) as

<p>I/O threads and vCPU threads already support setting schedulers, but until
now it was impossible to do so for the main QEMU thread (emulator thread in

<li><p><strong>Removed features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>vbox: Drop support for VirtualBox 4.x releases</p>
<p>Support for all the 4.x releases was ended by VirtualBox maintainers in
December 2015. Therefore, libvirt support for these releases is dropped.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improvements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>qemu: Use PCI by default for RISC-V guests</p>
<p>PCI support for RISC-V guests was already available in libvirt 5.1.0, but
it required the user to opt-in by manually assigning PCI addresses: with
this release, RISC-V guests will use PCI automatically when running against
a recent enough (4.0.0+) QEMU release.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Advertise firmware autoselection in domain capabilities</p>
<p>The firmware autoselection feature is now exposed in domain capabilities
and management applications can query for accepted values, i.e. values that
are accepted and for which libvirt found firmware descriptor files.
Firmware Secure Boot support is also advertised.</p>

<li><p><strong>New features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Add Storage Pool Capabilities output</p>
<p>Add support to list an enumerated list of supported Storage Pools via the
virConnectGetCapabilities API when connected via a Storage Driver. Add
support to get a more detailed list XML output Storage Pool Capabilities
vis the virConnectGetStoragePoolCapabilites API.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Support virtio-{non-}transitional device models</p>
<p><span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">virtio-transitional</span></span> and <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">virtio-non-transitional</span></span> <span class="docutils literal">model</span> values

<span class="docutils literal">scsi_host</span> . These new models can be used to give fine grained control
over what virtio device version is presented to the guest.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Enable firmware autoselection</p>
<p>Libvirt allows users to provide loader path for some time now. However,
this puts some burden on users because they need to know what firmware
meets their requirements. Now that QEMU ships firmware description files
this burden can be moved onto libvirt. It is as easy as setting the
<span class="docutils literal">firmware</span> attribute in the <span class="docutils literal">os</span> element (accepted values are <span class="docutils literal">bios</span>
and <span class="docutils literal">efi</span> ). Moreover, libvirt automatically enables domain features
needed for firmware it chooses.</p>
</li>
<li><p>snapshots: Add support for topological listings</p>
<p>A new flag VIR_DOMAIN_SNAPSHOT_LIST_TOPOLOGICAL is available for the
various snapshot listing APIs such as virDomainListAllSnapshots(). For
drivers that support the flag, the listed snapshots are guaranteed to be
sorted such that parents occur before children.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Xen: Add support for max grant frames setting</p>
<p>Add support for Xen's max_grant_frames setting by adding a new xenbus
controller type with a maxGrantFrames attribute. E.g. <span class="docutils literal">&lt;controller <span class="pre">type='xenbus'</span> <span class="pre">maxGrantFrames='64'/&gt;</span></span></p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Add support for parallel migration</p>
<p>With QEMU 4.0.0 libvirt can enable parallel migration which causes the
memory pages to be processed in parallel by several threads and sent to the
destination host using several connections at the same time. This may
increase migration speed in case a single thread is unable to saturate the
network link.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Removed features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Drop support for Upstart and "Red Hat" init scripts</p>
<p>Not a single one of the platforms we target still uses Upstart, and the
Upstart project itself has been abandoned for several years now; the same
is true for the "Red Hat" (really System V) init scripts, since RHEL 7 and
later releases use systemd.</p>
</li>

</li>
<li><p><strong>Improvements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Report class information for PCI node device capability.</p></li>
<li><p>Split setup of IPv4 and IPv6 top level chain</p>
<p>The requirement resulting from private chains improvement done in
<span class="docutils literal">v5.1.0</span> was refined so that only tables from corresponding IP version
are required. This means that if a network doesn't have <span class="docutils literal">IPv6</span> enabled
then those tables are not required.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Don't default to building the QEMU driver</p>
<p>Historically, the QEMU driver has been special in that it was enabled by
default, with the option to explicitly opt-out of it; starting now, we're
enabling it opportunistically if we detect that all requirements are
available, just like we do with other drivers.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><p>virt-host-validate: Fix IOMMU check on s390x</p></li>
<li><p>qemu: Allow creating pSeries guests with graphics and no USB mouse</p>
<p>It's now possible to prevent libvirt from automatically adding a USB mouse
to pSeries guests by including a USB tablet in the input XML: doing so is
desiderable as using a tablet results in a much better user experience when
working with GUIs.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Set $HOME and XGD variables for qemu:///system guests</p>

<li><p>network: Support setting a firewalld "zone" for virtual network bridges</p>
<p>All libvirt virtual networks with bridges managed by libvirt (i.e. those
with forward mode of "nat", "route", "open", or no forward mode) will now
be placed in a special firewalld zone called "libvirt" by default. The zone
of any network bridge can be changed using the <span class="docutils literal">zone</span> attribute of the
network's <span class="docutils literal">bridge</span> element.</p>
</li>
<li><p>bhyve: Support for ignoring unknown MSRs reads and writes</p>
<p>A new &lt;features&gt; element &lt;msrs unknown='ignore'/&gt; was introduced and the

reads and writes.</p>

<p>Users can now limit the bandwidth of post-copy migration, e.g. via <span class="docutils literal">virsh migrate <span class="pre">--postcopy-bandwidth</span></span> .</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improvements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Create private chains for virtual network firewall rules</p>
<p>Historically firewall rules for virtual networks were added straight into
the base chains. This works but has a number of bugs and design
limitations. To address them, libvirt now puts firewall rules into its own
chains. Note that with this change the <span class="docutils literal">filter</span> , <span class="docutils literal">nat</span> and <span class="docutils literal">mangle</span>
tables are required for both <span class="docutils literal">IPv4</span> and <span class="docutils literal">IPv6</span> .</p>
</li>
<li><p>Detect CEPH and GPFS as shared FS</p>
<p>When starting a migration libvirt performs some sanity checks to make sure
domain will be able to run on the destination. One of the requirements is
that the disk has to either be migrated too or be accessible from a network
filesystem. CEPH and GPFS weren't detected as a network filesystem.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Advertise network MTU via DHCP when specified</p>
<p>If network MTU is set and the network has DHCP enabled, advertise the MTU
in DHCP transaction too so that clients can adjust their link accordingly.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Allocate memory at the configured NUMA nodes from start</p>
<p>Libvirt used to just start QEMU, let it allocate memory for the guest, and
then use CGroups to move the memory to configured NUMA nodes. This is
suboptimal as huge chunks of memory have to be moved. Moreover, this relies
on ability to move memory later which is not always true. A change was made
to set process affinity correctly from the start so that memory is
allocated on the configured nodes from the beginning.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Support for newer Wireshark</p>
<p>Adapt libvirt to use the more recent release requiring a source build
configuration of libvirt <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--with-wireshark</span></span> to upgrade to the more recent
version.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Batch mode virsh and virt-admin parsing improvements</p>
<p>When parsing a single-argument command_string in batch mode, virsh and
virt-admin now permit newlines in addition to semicolons for splitting
commands, and backslash-newline for splitting long lines, to be more like
shell parsing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Bug fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>qemu: Use CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE during QEMU capabilities probing</p>
<p>By default, libvirt runs the QEMU process as <span class="docutils literal">qemu:qemu</span> which could
cause issues during probing as some features like AMD SEV might be
inaccessible to QEMU because of file system permissions. Therefore,
<span class="docutils literal">CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE</span> is granted to overcome these for the purposes of
probing.</p>
</li>
<li><p>storage: Add default mount options for fs/netfs storage pools</p>
<p>Altered the command line generation for fs/netfs storage pools to add some
default options. For Linux based systems, the options added are "nodev,
nosuid, noexec". For FreeBSD based systems, the options added are "nosuid,
noexec".</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Allow use of PCI for RISC-V guests</p>
<p>This works with QEMU 4.0.0+ only and is opt-in at the moment, since it
requires users to manually assign PCI addresses, but is otherwise fully
functional.</p>
</li>
<li><p>network: Fix virtual networks on systems using firewalld+nftables</p>
<p>Because of the transitional state of firewalld's new support for nftables,
not all iptables features required by libvirt are yet available, so libvirt
must continue to use iptables for its own packet filtering rules even when
the firewalld backend is set to use nftables. However, due to the way
iptables support is implemented in kernels using nftables (iptables rules
are converted to nftables rules and processed in a separate hook from the
native nftables rules), guest networking was broken on hosts with firewalld
configured to use nftables as the backend. This has been fixed by putting
libvirt-managed bridges in their own firewalld zone, so that guest traffic
can be forwarded beyond the host and host services can be exposed to guests
on the virtual network without opening up those same services to the rest
of the physical network. This means that host access from virtual machines
is no longer controlled by the firewalld default zone (usually "public"),
but rather by the new firewalld zone called "libvirt" (unless configured
otherwise using the new zone attribute of the network bridge element).</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Fix i6300esb watchdog hotplug on Q35</p>
<p>Ensure that libvirt allocates a PCI address for the device so that QEMU did
not default to an address that would not allow for device hotplug.</p>
</li>
<li><p>lxc: Don't reboot host on virDomainReboot</p>
<p>If the container is really a simple one (init is just bash and the whole
root is passed through) then virDomainReboot and virDomainShutdown would
reboot or shutdown the host. The solution is to use different method to
reboot or shutdown the container in that case (e.g. signal).</p>
</li>
<li><p>rpc: Various stream fixes</p>
<p>One particular race was fixed, one locking problem and error reporting from
streams was made better.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Fix guestfwd hotplug/hotunplug</p>
<p>Fixed the generation of the guestfwd hotplug/unplug command sent to QEMU to
match the syntax used when creating the initial command line.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Forbid CDROMs on virtio bus</p>
<p>Attempting to create an empty virtio-blk drive or attempting to eject it
results into an error. Forbid configurations where users would attempt to
use CDROMs in virtio bus.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Use 'raw' for 'volume' disks without format</p>
<p>Storage pools might want to specify format of the image when translating
the volume thus libvirt can't add any default format when parsing the XML.
Add an explicit format when starting the VM and format is not present
neither by user specifying it nor by the storage pool translation function.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Assume 'raw' default storage format also for network storage</p>
<p>Post parse callback adds the 'raw' type only for local files. Remote files
can also have backing store (even local) so we should do this also for
network backed storage.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Fix block job progress reporting and advocate for READY event</p>
<p>In some cases QEMU can get to 100% and still not reach the synchronised
phase. Initiating a pivot in that case will fail. Therefore it is strongly
advised to wait for <span class="docutils literal">VIR_DOMAIN_BLOCK_JOB_READY</span> event which does not
suffer from this problem.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Don't format image properties for empty drive</p>
<p>If a <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-drive</span></span> has no image, then formatting attributes such as cache,
readonly, etc. would cause errors to be reported from QEMU. This was fixed
by not supplying the attributes for devices without an image.</p>
</li>
<li><p>External snapshot metadata redefinition is fixed</p>
<p>Attempting to use VIR_DOMAIN_SNAPSHOT_CREATE_REDEFINE to reinstate the
metadata describing an external snapshot created earlier for an offline
domain no longer fails.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>New features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Xen: Add support for openvswitch</p>
<p>The libxl driver now supports virtual interfaces that connect to an
openvswitch bridge, including interfaces with VLAN tagging and trunking
configuration.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Report whether KVM nesting is available</p>
<p>Running nested KVM guests requires specific configuration steps to be
performed on the host; libvirt will now report in the host capabilities
whether KVM nesting support is available.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Removed features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Drop UML driver</p>
<p>The UML driver was unmaintained and not tested for quite some time now.
Worse, there is a bug that causes it to deadlock on some very basic
operations (e.g. dumping domain XML). These facts make us believe no one
uses it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improvements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>qemu: Add support for ARMv6l guests</p></li>
<li><p>Support more NVDIMM configuration options</p>
<p>Introduce more configuration options. For the source element, add the
'alignsize' and 'pmem' subelements. For the target element, add the
'readonly' subelement.</p>
</li>
<li><p>cpu: Add support for "stibp" x86_64 feature</p>
<p>Add cpu flag stibp (Single Thread Indirect Branch Predictors) to prevent
indirect branch predictions from being controlled by the sibling
Hyperthread.</p>
</li>
<li><p>libxl: Handle external domain destroy</p>
<p>Historically, if a domain was destroyed using <span class="docutils literal">xl</span> rather than through
libvirt APIs, libvirt would not be aware of the fact and keep considering
it as running. This is no longer the case.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Start selecting the first available DRI device for OpenGL operations</p>
<p>If OpenGL support is needed (either with SPICE gl enabled or with
egl-headless), libvirt is now able to pick the first available DRI device
for the job. At the same time, this improvement is also a bugfix as it
prevents permission-related issues with regards to our mount namespaces and
the default DRI render node's permissions which would normally prevent QEMU
from accessing such a device.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Add support for postcopy-requests migration statistics</p>
<p>The <span class="docutils literal">virDomainJobInfo</span> can get number page requests received from the
destination host during post-copy migration.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Bug fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>lxc: Don't forbid interfaces with type=direct</p>
<p>Such interfaces are supported by lxc and should be allowed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Fully clean up RNG devices on detach</p>
<p>Some RNG device types, such as those using EGD, might need extra clean up
on the host in addition to removing the guest-side device.</p>

<p>The QEMU driver now has support for Hyper-V PV IPI and Enlightened VMCS for
Windows and Hyper-V guests.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Added support for PCI devices on S390</p>
<p>PCI addresses can now include the new zpci element which contains uid
(user-defined identifier) and fid (PCI function identifier) attributes and
makes the corresponding devices usable by S390 guests.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Support changing IOThread polling parameters for a live guest</p>
<p>Introduced virDomainSetIOThreadParams which allows dynamically setting the
IOThread polling parameters used by QEMU to manage the thread polling
interval and the algorithm for growth or shrink of the polling time. The
values only affect a running guest with IOThreads. The guest's IOThread
polling values can be viewed via the domain statistics.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Xen: Add support for PVH</p>
<p>The libxl driver now supports Xen's PVH virtual machine type. PVH machines
are enabled with the new "xenpvh" OS type, e.g.
<span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;os&gt;&lt;type&gt;xenpvh&lt;/type&gt;&lt;/os&gt;</span></span></p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Added support for CMT (Cache Monitoring Technology)</p>
<p>Introduced cache monitoring using the <span class="docutils literal">monitor</span> element in <span class="docutils literal">cachetune</span>
for vCPU threads. Added interfaces to get and display the cache utilization
statistics through the command 'virsh domstats' via the
virConnectGetAllDomainStats API.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Add support for nested HV for pSeries guests</p>
<p>Nested HV support makes it possible to run nested (L2) guests with minimal
performance penalty when compared to regular (L1) guests on ppc64 hardware.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Bug fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Xen: Handle soft reset shutdown event</p>
<p>The pvops Linux kernel uses soft reset to handle the crash machine
operation. The libxl driver now supports the soft reset shutdown event,
allowing proper crash handling of pvops-based HVM domains.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>rpc: Make 'genprotocol' output reproducible</p>
<p>This is another step towards making libvirt builds fully reproducible.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Bug fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>security: Fix permissions for UNIX sockets</p>
<p>Since 4.5.0, libvirt is using FD passing to hand sockets over to QEMU,
which in theory removes the need for them to be accessible by the user
under which the QEMU process is running; however, other processes such as
vdsm need to access the sockets as well, which means adjusting permissions
is still necessary.</p>
</li>
<li><p>cpu_map: Add Icelake model definitions</p>
<p>These CPU models will be available in the upcoming 3.1.0 QEMU release.</p>
</li>
<li><p>util: Properly parse URIs with missing trailing slash</p>
<p>Some storage URIs were not parsed correctly, in which case libvirt ended up
emitting XML that it would then refuse to parse back.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Xen: Drop support for Xen 4.4 and 4.5</p>
<p>Xen 4.4 and 4.5 are no longer supported by the Xen community. Drop support
for these older versions and require Xen &gt;= 4.6.</p>
</li>
<li><p>nwfilter: Disallow binding creation in session mode</p>
<p>Ensure that a filter binding creation is not attempted in session mode and
generates a proper error message.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improvements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>qemu: Retrieve guest hostname through QEMU Guest Agent command</p>
<p>QEMU is now able to retrieve the guest hostname using a new QEMU-GA command
called 'guest-get-host-name'. Virsh users can execute 'domhostname' for
QEMU driver for domains configured to use the Guest Agent.</p>
</li>
<li><p>virsh: Implement vsh-table in virsh and virsh-admin</p>
<p>The new API fixes problems with table-alignment, making the tables more
readable and deals with unicode.</p>

it optional.</p>
</li>

<li><p>qemu: Make default machine type independent of QEMU</p>
<p>We can't control whether or not QEMU will change its default machine type
in the future, or whether downstream distributions will decide to compile
out some machine types, so our only option to provide a predictable
behavior is taking care of the default ourselves; management applications
and users are encouraged to explicitly pick a machine type when creating
new guests.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Remove support for qcow/default encrypted volumes</p>
<p>Disallow using a qcow encrypted volume for the guest and disallow creation
of the qcow or default encrypted volume from the storage driver. Support
for qcow encrypted volumes has been phasing out since QEMU 2.3 and by QEMU
2.9 creation of a qcow encrypted volume via qemu-img required usage of
secret objects, but that support was never added to libvirt.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Make GnuTLS mandatory</p>
<p>Building without GnuTLS is no longer possible.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Remove allow_disk_format_probing configuration option</p>

<p>Alter the <span class="docutils literal">domblkinfo</span> command to add the option --all in order to
display the size details of each domain block device from one command in a
output table.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Allow concurrent access to monitor and guest agent</p>
<p>Historically libvirt prevented concurrent accesses to the qemu monitor and
the guest agent. Therefore two independent calls (one querying the monitor
and the other querying guest agent) would serialize which hurts
performance. The code was reworked to allow two independent calls run at
the same time.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Allow configuring the page size for HPT pSeries guests</p>
<p>For HPT pSeries guests, the size of the host pages used to back guest

<li><p>qemu: Add support for NBD over TLS</p>
<p>NBD volumes can now be accessed securely.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Implement FD passing for Unix sockets</p>
<p>Instead of having QEMU open the socket and then connecting to it, which is
inherently racy, starting with QEMU 2.12 we can open the socket ourselves
and pass it to QEMU, avoiding race conditions.</p>
</li>
<li><p>virsh: Introduce --nowait option for domstat command</p>
<p>When this option is specified, virsh will try to fetch the guest stats but
abort instead of stalling if they can't be retrieved right away.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Bug fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>qemu: Fix a potential libvirtd crash on VM reconnect</p>
<p>Initialization of the driver worker pool needs to come before libvirtd
trying to reconnect to all machines, since one of the QEMU processes migh
have already emitted events which need to be handled prior to us getting to
the worker pool initialization.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Fix domain resume after failed migration</p>
<p>Recent versions of QEMU activate block devices before the guest CPU has
been started, which makes it impossible to roll back a failed migration.
Use the <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">late-block-activate</span></span> migration capability if supported to avoid
the issue.</p>

<p>It's now possible to use the VIR_MIGRATE_TLS flag together with
VIR_MIGRATE_NON_SHARED_DISK. The connection is then secured using the TLS
environment which is setup for the migration connection.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Add support for VM Generation ID</p>
<p>The VM Generatation ID exposes a 128-bit, cryptographically random, integer

<p>Unlike the old virConnectCompareCPU and virConnectBaselineCPU APIs, both
new APIs consider capabilities of a specific hypervisor.</p>

<p>Libvirt now allows mediated devices to be hot plugged and hot unplugged
from a guest rather than reporting an error that this isn't supported. In
fact, kernel has been supporting this since 4.10.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Bug fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Improve handling of device mapper targets</p>
<p>When starting a domain with a disk backed by a device mapper volume libvirt
also needs to allow the storage backing the device mapper in CGroups. In
the past kernel did not care, but starting from 4.16 CGroups are consulted
on each access to the device mapper target.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>New features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Support building with Python 3</p>
<p>Python is required to build libvirt, and up until now only Python 2 could
be used as an interpreter. All scripts used during build have now been made
compatible with Python 3, which means both major releases of the language
are fully supported.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Provide ccw address support for graphics and input devices</p>
<p>Support the virtio-gpu-ccw device as a video device and virtio-{keyboard,
mouse, tablet}-ccw devices as input devices on S390.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improvements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>qemu: Add logging of guest crash information on S390</p>
<p>On S390, when the guest crashes and QEMU exposes the guest crash
information, log the relevant data to the domain log file.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: use arp table of host to get the IP address of guests</p>
<p>Find IP address of a VM by arp table on hosts. If someone customizing IP
address inside VM, it will be helpful.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Xen: Remove hard-coded scheduler weight</p>
<p>The libxl driver was accidentally hard-coding the per-domain scheduler
weight to 1000, silently ignoring any user-provided <span class="docutils literal">&lt;shares&gt;</span> in
<span class="docutils literal">&lt;cputune&gt;</span> . The driver now honors <span class="docutils literal">&lt;shares&gt;</span> , and defers setting a
default value to Xen. Note that the Xen default is 256, so any domains
started after this improvement will have one fourth the shares of
previously started domains. If all domains must have equal CPU shares,
administrators must manually set the weight of previously started domains
to 256, or restart them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Bug fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>qemu: TLS migration now enforces use of TLS for the NBD connection</p>
<p>When the VIR_MIGRATE_TLS flag was used with the migration API libvirt did
not ensure that the NBD connection was using TLS as well. The code now
rejects such migration as the TLS transport for NBD is not ready yet, but
prevents a false sense of security that TLS would be used. The support TLS
for NBD will be added soon.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>New features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Added support for CAT (Cache allocation Technology)</p>
<p>Domain vCPU threads can now have allocated some parts of host cache using
the <span class="docutils literal">cachetune</span> element in <span class="docutils literal">cputune</span> .</p>
</li>
<li><p>Allow opening secondary drivers</p>
<p>Up until now it was possible to connect to only hypervisor drivers (e.g.
qemu:///system, lxc:///, vbox:///system, and so on). The internal drivers
(like network driver, node device driver, etc.) were hidden from users and
users could use them only indirectly. Starting with this release new
connection URIs are accepted. For instance network:///system,
storage:///system and so on.</p>
</li>
<li><p>virtlogd, virtlockd: Add support for admin protocol</p>
<p>These two daemons now support admin protocol through which some admin info
can be gathered or some configuration tweaked on the fly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improvements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>virsh: Enhance bash completion</p>
<p>Implement more bash completions so that basic libvirt objects can be
auto-completed (e.g. networks, interfaces, NWFilters, and so on).</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Use VIR_ERR_DEVICE_MISSING for various hotplug/detach messages</p></li>
<li><p>qemu: Allow showing the dump progress for memory only dump</p>
<p>Alter the QEMU dump-guest-memory command processing to check for and allow
asynchronous completion which then allows for the virsh dump --memory-only
--verbose command to display percent completion data.</p>
</li>
<li><p>conf: add support for setting Chassis SMBIOS data fields</p></li>
<li><p>libxl: add support for setting clock offset and adjustment</p></li>
<li><p>Make port allocator global</p>
<p>Up until now each driver had their own port allocator module. This meant
that info on port usage was not shared. Starting with this release, the
port allocator module is made global and therefore drivers allocate ports
from global pool.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Fixed some compiler warnings that appear with GCC 8</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Bug fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>qemu: Check for unsafe migration more thoroughly</p>
<p>If a domain disk is stored on local filesystem (e.g. ext4) but is not being
migrated it is very likely that domain is not able to run on destination.
Regardless of share/cache mode.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Fix updating device with boot order</p>
<p>Starting with 3.7.0 release updating any device with boot order would fail
with 'boot order X is already used by another device' while in fact it was
the very same device.</p>
</li>
<li><p>virlog: determine the hostname on startup CVE-2018-6764</p>
<p>At later point it might not be possible or even safe to use getaddrinfo().
It can in turn result in a load of NSS module which can even be loaded from
unsage guest filesystem and thus escape the confinment of its container.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Rework vCPU statistics fetching</p>
<p>Fetching vCPU statistics was very expensive because it lead to waking up
vCPU threads in QEMU and thus it degraded performance. The code was
reworked so that fetching statistics does not wake up halted vCPUs.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: unlink memory backing file on domain shutdown</p>
<p>Depending on the filesystem where domain memory is stored, some files might
have been left behind. This is not a problem on hugetlbfs, but it is a
problem on regular filesystems like ext4.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Fix shutting down domains in parallel</p>
<p>If multiple domains were being shut down in parallel, libvirtd might have
deadlocked.</p>
</li>
<li><p>nodedev: Update PCI mdev capabilities dynamically</p>
<p>PCI devices may have other nested capabilities, like SRIOV and mdev which
depend on the device being plugged into the native vendor driver. However,
in case such a device is directly assigned to a guest using VFIO driver,
the device will naturally lose these capabilities and libvirt needs to
reflect that.</p>

</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improvements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>CPU frequency reporting improvements</p>
<p>The CPU frequency will now be reported by <span class="docutils literal">virsh nodeinfo</span> and other
tools for s390 hosts; at the same time; CPU frequency has been disabled on
aarch64 hosts because there's no way to detect it reliably.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>New features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>conf: Support defining distances between virtual NUMA cells</p>
<p>A NUMA hardware architecture supports the notion of distances between NUMA
cells. This can now be specified using the <span class="docutils literal">&lt;distances&gt;</span> element within
the NUMA cell configuration. Drivers which support this include Xen and
QEMU.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Xen: Support defining vNUMA topology</p>
<p>Xen now supports defining a virtual NUMA topology for VMs, including
specifying distances between NUMA cells.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Add the ability to configure HPT resizing for pSeries guests</p>
<p>The user can now decide whether HPT (Hash Page Table) resizing should be
enabled, disabled or required instead of leaving it up to hypervisor
defaults and negotiation between the guest and the host.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Add vmcoreinfo feature</p>
<p>Starting with QEMU 2.11, the guest can save kernel debug details when this
feature is enabled and the kernel supports it. It is useful to process
kernel dump with KASLR enabled, and also provides various kernel details to
crash tools.</p>
</li>
<li><p>conf: Move the auth and encryption definitions to disk source</p>
<p>Allow parsing and formatting of the <span class="docutils literal">auth</span> and <span class="docutils literal">encryption</span>
sub-elements to be a child of the <span class="docutils literal">source</span> element. This will allow
adding an <span class="docutils literal">auth</span> sub-element to a <span class="docutils literal">backingStore</span> or <span class="docutils literal">mirror</span> elements
as a means to track specific authentication and/or encryption needs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improvements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>vbox: Add VirtualBox 5.2 support</p></li>
<li><p>vbox: Add support for configuring storage controllers</p>
<p>The VirtualBox driver now supports the <span class="docutils literal">&lt;controller&gt;</span> element in the
domain XML for configuring storage controllers in VBOX VMs. Additionally,
libvirt's domain XML schema was updated to allow optional <span class="docutils literal">model</span>
attribute for <span class="docutils literal">&lt;controller <span class="pre">type='ide'&gt;</span></span> which is used by the VBOX driver
to set the IDE controller model to be one of 'piix4', 'piix4' (default), or
'ich6'. Finally, with this change <span class="docutils literal">dumpxml</span> generates <span class="docutils literal">&lt;controller&gt;</span>
elements that correspond to current VBOX VM storage controller
configuration.</p>
</li>
<li><p>vbox: Add support for attaching empty removable disks</p>
<p>The VirutalBox driver now supports adding CD-ROM and floppy disk devices
that do not have the disk source specified. Previously such devices were
silently ignored.</p>
</li>
<li><p>vbox: Add support for attaching SAS storage controllers</p>
<p>In VirtualBox, SCSI and SAS are distinct controller types whereas libvirt
does not make such distinction. Therefore, the VBOX driver was updated to
allow attaching SAS controllers via <span class="docutils literal">&lt;controller <span class="pre">type='scsi'</span> <span class="pre">model='lsisas1068'&gt;</span></span> element. If there are both SCSI and SAS controllers
present in the VBOX VM, the domain XML can associate the disk device using
the <span class="docutils literal">&lt;address&gt;</span> element with the <span class="docutils literal">controller</span> attribute, and
optionally, set the port via <span class="docutils literal">unit</span> attribute.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Generate predictable paths for qemu memory backends</p>
<p>In some cases management applications need to know paths passed to
memory-backend-file objects upfront. Libvirt now generates predictable
paths so applications can prepare the files if they need to do so.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Shareable disks work properly with recent qemu</p>
<p>Recent qemu versions added image locking to avoid potential corruption of
disk images. This broke shareable disks with libvirt since the feature was
turned on by default in qemu. Libvirt now enables sharing of those disks in
qemu so that the image locking is not applied in that case. Additionally
libvirt now checks that shareable disks have supported format (raw) to
avoid metadata corruption.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Improve serial console behavior on non-x86 architectures</p>
<p>ppc64, aarch64 and s390x guests were treating the &lt;serial&gt; and &lt;console&gt;
elements differently from x86, in some cases presenting misleading
information to the user. The behavior is now consistent across all
architectures and the information reported is always accurate.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Bug fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>vbox: Do not ignore failures to attach disk devices when defining</p>
<p>The <span class="docutils literal">define</span> now fails and reports an error if any of the <span class="docutils literal">controller</span>
or <span class="docutils literal">disk</span> devices specified in the domain XML fail to attach to the
VirtualBox VM.</p>
</li>
<li><p>vbox: Fix dumpxml to always output disk devices</p>
<p>The VirtualBox driver was ignoring any disk devices in <span class="docutils literal">dumpxml</span> output
if there was a SAS storage controller attached to the VM.</p>
</li>
<li><p>vbox: Fix dumpxml to always generate valid domain XML</p>
<p>When a VirtualBox VM has multiple disks attached, each to a different
storage controller that uses 'sd' prefix for block device names e.g. one
disk attached to SATA and one to SCSI controller, it no longer generates
XML where both would have 'sda' device name assigned. Instead it properly
assigns 'sda' and 'sdb' to those disks in the order of appearance.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Securely pass iSCSI authentication data</p>
<p>Rather than supplying the authentication data as part of the iSCSI URL for
a disk or host device, utilize the encrypted secret object to securely pass
the authentication data.</p>

<p>Multiqueue support for <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">virtio-blk</span></span> has been available in QEMU ever since
2.7.0, and now libvirt guests can enable it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Add virDomainSetLifecycleAction API</p>
<p>Provided a new API to allow dynamic guest lifecycle control for guest
reactions to poweroff, restart, or crash type events related to the domain
XML <span class="docutils literal">on_poweroff</span> , <span class="docutils literal">on_reboot</span> , and <span class="docutils literal">on_crash</span> elements. The
<span class="docutils literal">virsh <span class="pre">set-lifecycle-action</span></span> command was created to control the actions.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Allow cold(un)plugging and hot(un)plugging input devices</p></li>
<li><p>net: Implement QoS for vhostuser</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improvements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Allow a logical volume to be create using LUKS</p>
<p>A logical volume may be created using an <span class="docutils literal">encryption</span> element using
"luks" format. This does require a previously created <span class="docutils literal">secret</span> to store
the passphrase used to encrypt the volume Adding the volume to a domain can
then either provide the secret or allow the consumer in the guest to
provide the passphrase in order to decrypt the volume.</p>
</li>
<li><p>net: Ignore auto-generated MAC address when detaching an interface</p>
<p>If the MAC address has not been specified by the user, libvirt will try and
fill in the gaps by generating one; however, for some error paths that led
to some confusing error messages, so when an auto-generated MAC address is
specified the error message will not include the auto-generated MAC.</p>
</li>
<li><p>net: Enable MAC address lookup for virDomainInterfaceStats</p></li>
<li><p>apparmor: Several improvements</p>
<p>Changes include permitting access to data about USB devices and <span class="docutils literal">dnsmasq</span>
instances, allowing spaces in guest names and many more.</p>
</li>
<li><p>cpu: Use CPU information obtained from QEMU when possible</p>
<p>Recent QEMU versions can expose information about which CPU models are
available and usable on the host; libvirt will now make use of such
information whenever possible.</p>
</li>
<li><p>hyperv: Various improvements</p>
<p>The error reported when clients can't connect to Hyper-V has been made more
descriptive, and memory limits for guests are now mapped to more
appropriate libvirt equivalents.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Report QEMU error on failed migration</p>
<p>Instead of reporting a generic error, ask QEMU for a more detailed and thus
hopefully more helpful one.</p>
</li>
<li><p>vbox: Implement autoport for RDP</p>
<p>libvirt will now obtain the (dynamically allocated) RDP port number from
VirtualBox itself, avoiding conflicts between multiple guests wanting to
use RDP at the same time.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Allow rotation of small logs</p>
<p>On a host where numerous unique instances are executed per day, it's quite
possible that, even though each of the single log files are fairly small,
collectively the quantity and volume may add tens of thousands of log files
to the <span class="docutils literal">/var/log/libvirt/qemu/</span> directory. Removing the constraints that
log have to be bigger than 100 KiB before they can be rotated solves the
issue.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Bug fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Fix swapped interface statistics and QoS</p>
<p>Due to internal implementation, reported statistics for some types of
interfaces were swapped (RX appeared in TX and vice versa). Similarly, QoS
was set in reversed way.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Properly resize local LUKS encrypted volume</p>
<p>Resizing of a local LUKS encrypted volume will now use qemu-img to resize
the volume. This will require configuring a secret for the LUKS encrypted
volume.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Reserve PCI addresses for implicit i440fx devices</p>
<p>Failing to do so causes the addresses to be considered usable by libvirt,
which means they could be assigned to more than one device resulting in the
guest failing to start.</p>
</li>
<li><p>spec: Restart libvirtd only at the end of the upgrade process</p>
<p>Use <span class="docutils literal">%posttrans</span> to make sure <span class="docutils literal">libvirtd</span> is not restarted before all
other components, such as the library itself and storage / hypervisor
drivers, have already been upgraded.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>qemu: Ensure TLS clients always verify the server certificate</p>
<p>While it's reasonable to turn off client certificate validation, as setting
it up can be non-trivial, clients should always verify the server
certificate to avoid MITM attacks. However, libvirt was using the same knob
to control both checks, leading to CVE-2017-1000256 / LSN-2017-0002.</p>

<p>When a <span class="docutils literal">rendernode</span> path is set for SPICE GL on <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">qemu:///system</span></span> , we
now correctly set DAC permissions on the device at VM startup. This is the

<p>Allow querying the NIC interface capabilities for the availability of
switchdev offloading (also known as kernel-forward-plane-offload).</p>
</li>
<li><p>New CPU models for AMD and Intel</p>
<p>AMD EPYC and Intel Skylake-Server CPU models were added together with their
features</p>
</li>
<li><p>Improve long waiting when saving a domain</p>
<p>While waiting for a write to disk to be finished, e.g. during save, even
simple operations like <span class="docutils literal">virsh list</span> would be blocking due to domain lock.
This is now resolved by unlocking the domain in places where it is not
needed.</p>

</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Bug fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Proper units are now used in virsh manpage for dom(mem)stats</p>
<p>Previously the documentation used multiples of 1000, but now it is fixed to
use multiples of 1024.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Fix error reporting when disk attachment fails</p>
<p>There was a possibility for the actual error to be overridden or cleared
during the rollback.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Fix assignment of graphics ports after daemon restart</p>
<p>This could be seen with newer kernels that have bug regarding SO_REUSEADDR.
After libvirtd was restarted it could assign already used address to new
guests which would make them fail to start. This is fixed by marking used
ports unavailable when reconnecting to running QEMU domains.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Fix message decoding which was causing a very strange bug</p>
<p>When parsing an RPC message with file descriptors was interrupted and had
to restart, the offset of the payload was calculated badly causing strange
issues like not being able to find a domain that was not requested.</p>

<li><p>qemu: Add managedsave-edit commands</p>
<p>Using managedsave-dumpxml, managedsave-define and managedsave-edit
commands, now we can dump and edit the XML configuration of domain which
has managedsave image.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Add migrate-getmaxdowntime command</p>
<p>Currently, the maximum tolerable downtime for a domain being migrated is
write-only from libvirt, via migrate-setmaxdowntime. This implements a
complementary migrate-getmaxdowntime command</p>
</li>
<li><p>bhyve: Support autoport for VNC ports</p>
<p>It's no longer necessary to explicitly specify VNC port for the bhyve
guests. With the autoport feature it will be allocated automatically.
Please refer to the bhyve driver documentation for examples.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Added support for setting heads of virtio GPU</p></li>
<li><p>qemu: Added support to configure reconnect timeout for chardev devices</p>
<p>When you have a TCP or UNIX chardev device and it's connected somewhere you
can configure reconnect timeout if the connection is closed.</p>

<li><p><strong>Improvements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>qemu: Report a clear error when dropping a VM during startup</p>
<p>"Failed to load config for domain 'DOMNAME'" is now reported if a VM config
can't be parsed for some reason, and thus provides a clear indication for
users (and devs).</p>
</li>
<li><p>apparmor: Update for QEMU 2.10 compatibility</p>
<p>Starting with QEMU 2.10, disk images and NVRAM files get automatically
locked to prevent them from being corrupted; however, file locking needs to
be explicitly allowed through <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">virt-aa-helper</span></span> or AppArmor will reject
the requests and the guest will not be able to run.</p>
</li>
<li><p>virsh: List Unix sockets in 'domdisplay' output</p>
<p>VNC and SPICE graphics can use Unix sockets instead of TCP/IP sockets as
connection endpoints, but such a configuration was not handled correctly by
<span class="docutils literal">virsh domdisplay</span> , causing the respective endpoints to be missing from
the output.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Don't check whether offline migration is safe</p>
<p>Since offline migration only copies the guest definition to the destination
host, data corruption is not a concern and the operation can always be

<li><p><strong>Bug fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>qemu: Better support for international domain names (with wide characters)</p>
<p>There were some issues with multi-byte domains getting lost on daemon
restart due to truncation, so the code now handles multi-byte names a bit
better.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Support long domain names with namespaces</p>
<p>Domains with extremely long names would fail to start due to temporary
namespace paths being created with the whole name. The path is now
generated with shortened name instead.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Tolerate missing emulator binary during libvirtd restart</p>
<p>For some time libvirt required qemu capabilities being present when parsing
VM configs during startup. As a side effect VM configs would fail to parse
and thus vanish, if the emulator binary would be uninstalled or broken.
Libvirt now tolerates when capabilities are missing during startup.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Prevent pSeries guests from disappearing in some situations</p>
<p>pSeries guest would disappear if any of the host devices they were
configured to use was not available during libvirtd startup, which could
easily happen for SR-IOV Virtual Functions. This scenario is now handled
correctly.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Honor &lt;on_reboot/&gt; setting</p>
<p>The setting was accepted by the parser, but not actually implemented.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Fix --verbose option for all daemons</p>
<p>Since v3.0.0, the option had been ignored by all libvirt daemons (
<span class="docutils literal">libvirtd</span> , <span class="docutils literal">virtlogd</span> and <span class="docutils literal">virtlockd</span> ); it's now working as
intended once again.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>hyperv: Implement virDomainSetMemory and virDomainSendKey APIs</p></li>
<li><p>qemu: Support multiple PHBs for pSeries guests</p>
<p>pSeries guests can now have multiple PHBs (PCI Host Bridges), which show up
as separate PCI domains in the guest. To create additional PHBs, simply add
PCI controllers with model <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pci-root</span></span> to the guest configuration.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Isolate hostdevs on pSeries guests</p>
<p>To enable better error reporting and recovery, unrelated hostdevs will now
be automatically isolated on pSeries guests by placing them on separate
PHBs (PCI Host Bridges).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improvements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>qemu: platform serial devices can now use chardev features</p>
<p>QEMU VMs that depend on platform serial devices can now use QEMU's
<span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-chardev</span></span> option, which enables access to advanced features like log
file configuration. This applies to the default serial devices for arm,
aarch64, and some ppc configurations.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Require use of GCC 4.4 or Clang compilers</p>
<p>We only ever test libvirt with GCC or Clang (which provides a GCC
compatible compilation environment). Between them, these compilers cover
every supported operating system platform, including Windows.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: shared disks with directsync cache should be safe for migration</p>
<p>At present shared disks can be migrated with either readonly or
<span class="docutils literal">cache=none</span> . But <span class="docutils literal">cache=directsync</span> should be safe for migration,
because both <span class="docutils literal">cache=directsync</span> and <span class="docutils literal">cache=none</span> don't use the host
page cache, and <span class="docutils literal">cache=direct</span> write through qemu block layer cache.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Handle hotplug change on VLAN configuration using OVS</p>
<p>Libvirt was taught to handle VLAN change for running OVS interface.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Bug fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>qemu: Use vCPU 'node-id' property and pass it back to qemu</p>
<p>vCPU properties gathered from query-hotpluggable-cpus need to be passed
back to QEMU. As QEMU did not use the node-id property until now and
libvirt forgot to pass it back properly (it was parsed but not passed
around) we did not honor this.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Miscellaneous stream fixes</p>
<p>After introducing sparse stream features there were still some known bugs
left. Those are fixed in this release.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Miscellaneous domain NS fixes</p>
<p>Libvirt starts qemu domains in separate Linux namespaces for a while now.
However, there were still some bugs lingering. For instance libvirt did not
know how to handle file based bind mounts.</p>

<h1>v3.5.0 (2017-07-04)<a class="headerlink" href="#v3-5-0-2017-07-04" title="Link to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>New features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>qemu: Add support for loadparm for a boot device</p>
<p>Add an optional boot parameter 'loadparm' for a boot device. Loadparm is an
8 byte parameter that, when present, is queried by S390 guests via sclp or
diag 308. Linux guests on S390 use it to select a boot entry.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Support controlling how video devices are exposed to the bhyve guests</p>
<p>The <span class="docutils literal">vgaconf</span> attribute was added to <span class="docutils literal">video</span> 's <span class="docutils literal">driver</span> element.
Possible values are: <span class="docutils literal">on</span> , <span class="docutils literal">off</span> , and <span class="docutils literal">io</span> . It controls the way
how bhyve exposes video devices to its guests; various guest OSes might
require different settings to boot properly.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Add support for live updates of coalesce settings</p>
<p>Users can now use <span class="docutils literal">virsh <span class="pre">update-device</span></span> to change the coalesce settings
of an interfaces while the domain is running.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Allow VirtIO devices to use vIOMMU</p>
<p>It is now possible to turn on IOTBL for the vIOMMU and have VirtIO devices
use it, provided they have been configured appropriately.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improvements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>qemu: block copy job can be used with persistent domains</p>
<p>Until now it was not possible to use block copy with persistent VMs. In use
cases where it's not required to recover the job after VM shutdown, it's
possible to specify VIR_DOMAIN_BLOCK_COPY_TRANSIENT_JOB flag to start the
copy job.</p>
</li>
<li><p>JSON pseudo-protocol backing store parser supports new format of qemu 2.9</p>
<p>QEMU 2.9 modified a few structures corresponding to the JSON format of
specifying a backing store for a disk image. Libvirt now implements the new
format.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Capabilities now include info about host's CAT settings</p>
<p>Various information about resource control from the host is gathered and
presented in capabilities if available.</p>
</li>
<li><p>apparmor: Several improvements</p>
<p>Allow access to Ceph config, EFI firmware on both x86_64 and aarch64,
device tree on ppc64 and more.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Support host-model on POWER9 machines</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Bug fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>qemu: snapshot: retrieve image metadata from user provided files</p>
<p>Disk images of an external snapshot created with
VIR_DOMAIN_SNAPSHOT_CREATE_REUSE_EXT flag specified would not be scanned
for metadata after recent changes. The metadata is necessary to allow
keeping relative paths between images when doing a block-commit.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Parse decimal numbers in a locale-independent way</p>
<p>Some locales, such as <span class="docutils literal">de_DE</span> and <span class="docutils literal">pt_BR</span> , use comma rather than dot
to separate the integer part from the fractional part of a decimal number;
however, several data sources such as the kernel use a locale-independent
representation and need to be treated accordingly.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Support compilation with newer compiler and libc versions</p>
<p>Several fixes have been included to make compilation with Clang 4.0.0, GCC
7.1 and glibc &gt;= 2.25.90 possible.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Query name for vhost-user interfaces at runtime</p>
<p>This makes it possible to use <span class="docutils literal">virsh</span> subcommands such as <span class="docutils literal">domiflist</span>
and <span class="docutils literal">domifstat</span> on vhost-user interfaces.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Set MTU for hotplugged interfaces correctly</p>
<p>When hotplugging a network interface, the MTU was only set on the guest
side. Set it on the host side as well.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Forbid updating MTU for interfaces of running guests</p>
<p>The MTU setting can't be modified while the guest is running, so any
attempt to alter it at runtime will now result in an error rather than
being silently ignored.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Fix specifying QXL heads with older QEMU releases</p>
<p>Specifying the number of QXL heads was not working correctly for QEMU
releases older than 1.6.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Fix migration to older libvirt/QEMU versions</p>
<p>When the guest is started, libvirt updates the CPU definition to reflect
the actual CPU features to enforce ABI. We need to send original and
updated CPU definition in order to support migration to older libvirt/QEMU
versions. Only the updated CPU definition was sent to destination.</p>

<h1>v3.4.0 (2017-06-02)<a class="headerlink" href="#v3-4-0-2017-06-02" title="Link to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>New features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Improved streams to efficiently transfer sparseness</p>
<p>New extension to virStream was implemented so that virStorageVolDownload
and virStorageVolUpload can preserve file sparseness.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I/O APIC type can be specified for QEMU/KVM domains</p>
<p>The <span class="docutils literal">ioapic</span> tag was added to domain <span class="docutils literal">features</span> , so the type of the
I/O APIC can now be specified (e.g. putting it in userspace for KVM
domains).</p>
</li>
<li><p>The reason for VM shutdown is reported, if known</p>
<p>QEMU 2.10 will be able to report the reason for shutting down (whether that
was caused by the guest or not), and libvirt is prepared for that and
reports that information in its shutdown event as well, if it is known.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improvements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Repository now has new README.md file</p>
<p>The new file uses markdown syntax, so it looks better on github and
possibly other web pages, but it has also more useful information. The old
README is now symlink to the new file.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Use GICv2 by default for aarch64/virt TCG guests</p>
<p>The emulated GICv3 has some limitations that make it unusable as a default;
use GICv2 until they're sorted out. This change makes it once again
possible to run aarch64/virt guests on a x86_64 host without having to
tweak their configuration.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Additional capabilities for the node_device module</p>
<p>Introduce two new capabilities to the node_device module. The first is for
CCW devices, most common on the S390 architecture. The second is for fibre
channel-backed SCSI devices and exposes the fc_remote_port sub-capability
to SCSI target devices.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Node devices now report Mediated device capabilities</p>
<p>Endpoint devices support new <span class="docutils literal">mdev</span> capability and their parents now
report the supported types in new <span class="docutils literal">mdev_types</span> capability.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Capabilities now report information about host caches</p>
<p>If supported in the kernel, host capabilities will now list L3 caches. The
code for other levels was added as well, but only L3 caches are reported
currently.</p>
</li>
<li><p>POWER9 CPU model was added</p>
<p>It is now properly reported in host capabilities.</p>
</li>
<li><p>libxl: NUMA sibling distances are now reported in host capabilities</p></li>
<li><p>VMDK version 3 files are now properly detected</p></li>
<li><p>Interrupt remapping and Extended interrupt mode for IOMMU devices</p>
<p>These two new features can now be controlled with new <span class="docutils literal">&lt;driver <span class="pre">intremap='on/off'</span> <span class="pre">eim='on/off'/&gt;</span></span> tag for <span class="docutils literal">iommu</span> devices.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Graphics in libxl domains now have default addresses</p>
<p>Even though there were default addresses before this change, they were not
saved in the XML. It is now possible to see and control the listen
addresses properly.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Default USB controllers are now added for devices in libxl domains</p>
<p>Even though they were added automatically when USB device was attached,
they could've been missing in some other cases. The logic is now fixed so
there are always USB controllers, even if there was none of them in the
specified XML.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Limits for RPC messages were increased</p>
<p>Hitting the RPC limits we have is easier every day, so they were increased
once again and some guessing logic was improved as well. It is now possible
to get more stats than ever using the <span class="docutils literal">virConnectGetAllDomainStats()</span>
call and push through even bigger requests and replies for all APIs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Bug fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>qemu: Create memory_backing_dir on startup</p>
<p>Libvirt's policy is that directories are created on startup if they don't
exist. We've missed this one.</p>
</li>
<li><p>PCIe 4.0 cards now report proper link speeds</p>
<p>It could happen that the link speed for PCIe devices was not properly
reported or the nodedev-dumpxml just failed. That was due to mistake in the
field width, but should now work properly.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Do not report errors on shutdown</p>
<p>For some users, in some rare cases, it could happen that there was an error
message "internal error: End of file from qemu monitor" in the logs even
though no problem happened. The detection of these false positives was
improved and such errors should not show any more.</p>
</li>
<li><p>User-specified UNIX socket paths for virtio channels should not be reset</p>
<p>It could happen, in some cases, that libvirt would mistake a user-specified
path for its own generated one and thus remove it from the XML. The
detection of such addresses was improved now.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Fix address reservation during RNG hot-plug</p>
<p>When error occurred in a specific point in time during the hot-plug of an
RNG device, it could happen that an address was released even though
another device was already using it, making it possible to hot-plug another
device with that address, effectively having duplicated addresses in the
XML.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>New features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>net: Add support for coalesce settings</p>
<p>Enabling data batching through these settings can improve network
performance for guests.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Add support for guest CPU cache specification</p>
<p>This features allows fine-grained control of the cache behavior of the
guest CPU.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Add support for the qemu-xhci USB controller</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improvements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>hyperv: Support Hyper-V 2012 and newer</p>
<p>Starting with Hyper-V 2012 the API has changed causing the existing driver
to be unable to send and process requests properly. This has been resolved
by adding abstractions to handle the differences and ease handling such
breaks if they happen in the future.</p>
</li>
<li><p>libxl: Add support for nested HVM domains</p>
<p>Xen has supported nested HVM domains since version 4.4. The libvirt libxl
driver now supports nested HVM domains by specifying the host-passthrough
CPU mode when defining a domain.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Implement ACPI support for aarch64 guests</p>
<p>Up until this point, ACPI support was only advertised for x86_64 guests and
disabling it for aarch64 guests was not possible at all.</p>
</li>
<li><p>vz: Add support for changing the number of vCPUs</p></li>
<li><p>qemu: Automatically choose the best USB controller for guests</p>
<p>The recently introduced qemu-xhci USB controller is the best choice for
both ppc64 and aarch64 guests, so use it by default on those architectures
if available.</p>
</li>
<li><p>daemon: Increase default task limit for libvirtd</p>
<p>The default number of tasks for the pids cgroup controller is 512, which
libvirtd can quickly bump into when starting lots of guests. Raise the
limit to a more reasonable 32768.</p>
</li>
<li><p>docs: Include man pages describing key code names and values</p></li>
<li><p>virsh: Report initialization errors</p>
<p>Sometimes virsh might be unable to start: when that happens, report useful
diagnostics instead of failing silently.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Bug fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>nss: Don't require a network restart for libvirt_guest</p>
<p>Previously, the libvirt_guest NSS module would only work properly after the
corresponding network had been restarted; now newly started guests will be
reported correctly right away.</p>
</li>
<li><p>storage: Remove unavailable transient pools after restart</p>
<p>Solve an issue where transient storage pools would be stuck in an
unmanageable state if the source disappeared and libvirtd was subsequently
restarted.</p>
</li>
<li><p>storage: Fix capacity value for LUKS encrypted volumes</p>
<p>The 'capacity' value (e.g. guest logical size) for a LUKS volume is smaller
than the 'physical' value of the file in the file system, so we need to
account for that.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Fix regression when hyperv/vendor_id feature is used</p>
<p>Guests using the feature would not be started at all; it is now possible to
start them as expected.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Do not crash on USB address with no port and invalid bus</p></li>
<li><p>crypto: Always pad data before encrypting it</p>
<p>If this step is not performed, when the data length matches the chunk size
the decryption routines will misinterpret the last byte of data as the
padding length and fail to decode it correctly.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>New features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The virt-host-validate tool now supports bhyve hypervisor</p></li>
<li><p>Introduce NVDIMM memory model</p>
<p>NVDIMM is new type of memory introduced into QEMU 2.6. The idea is that we
have a non-volatile memory module that keeps the data persistent across
domain reboots and offers much faster data accesses. However, due to a bug
in QEMU, this feature is not enabled for QEMUs older than 2.9.0.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Introduce support for generic PCIe Root Ports</p>
<p>For new controllers, a generic device (pcie-root-port) will be used by
default instead of the Intel-specific device (ioh3420), provided the QEMU
binary supports it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Add support for checking guest CPU ABI compatibility</p>
<p>When migrating a domain to a different host, restoring a domain from a file
or reverting a snapshot libvirt will make sure the guest CPU QEMU presents
to the guest OS exactly matches the one provided on the source host (or
before the domain's state was saved). This enhanced check may also be
requested when starting a new domain to ensure the virtual CPU exactly
matches the one specified in the XML.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Add support to migrate using TLS</p>
<p>Add the ability to migrate QEMU guests using TLS via a new flag
VIR_MIGRATE_TLS or virsh migrate '--tls' option. Requires using at least
QEMU 2.9.0 in order to work properly.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: add mediated devices framework support</p>
<p>Recent kernel version introduced new mediated device framework, so provide
an initial support of this framework for libvirt, mainly by introducing a
new host device type in the XML.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Add support for setting TSC frequency</p>
<p>Setting TSC frequency is required to enable migration for domains with
'invtsc' CPU feature turned on.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Add support for block device threshold event</p>
<p>When using thin provisioning, management tools need to resize the disk in
certain cases. To avoid having them to poll disk usage this version
introduces an event which will be fired when a given offset of the storage
is written by the hypervisor. Together with the API it allows registering
thresholds for given storage backing volumes and this event will then
notify management if the threshold is exceeded. Currently only the qemu
driver supports this.</p>
</li>
<li><p>bhyve: Add support for UEFI boot ROM, VNC, and USB tablet</p>
<p>The bhyve driver now supports booting using the UEFI boot ROM, so
non-FreeBSD guests that support UEFI could be booted without using an
external boot loader like grub-bhyve. Video is also supported now, allowing
to connect to guests via VNC and use an USB tablet as an input device.
Please refer to the driver page for domain XML examples.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improvements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>qemu: Detect host CPU model by asking QEMU on x86_64</p>
<p>Previously, libvirt detected the host CPU model using CPUID instruction,
which caused libvirt to detect a lot of CPU features that are not supported
by QEMU/KVM. Asking QEMU makes sure we don't start it with unsupported
features.</p>
</li>
<li><p>perf: Add more perf statistics</p>
<p>Add support to get the count of cpu clock time, task clock time, page
faults, context switches, cpu migrations, minor page faults, major page
faults, alignment faults, emulation faults by applications running on the
platform.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Write hyperv crash information into vm log</p>
<p>qemu's implementation of the hyperv panic notifier now reports information
about the crash from the guest os. Starting with this version, libvirt logs
the information to the vm log file for possible debugging.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Bug fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>QEMU: Use adaptive timeout for connecting to monitor</p>
<p>When starting qemu, libvirt waits for qemu to create the monitor socket
which libvirt connects to. Historically, there was sharp 30 second timeout
after which the qemu process was killed. This approach is suboptimal as in
some scenarios with huge amounts of guest RAM it can take a minute or more
for kernel to allocate and zero out pages for qemu. The timeout is now
flexible and computed by libvirt at domain startup.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Overwrite (clear) 2 KB instead of just 512 bytes when initializing logical
device</p></li>

<p>Add new storage backend to support pool and volume management within the
Virtuozzo Storage environment. Virtuozzo Storage is a highly available
distributed software defined storage with built-in replication and disaster
recovery.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Add support for memory backing with file source</p>
<p>Add support in numa topology for file source inside memory backing
(hugepages are not needed) Three new elements &lt;source/&gt;,&lt;access/&gt; and
&lt;allocation/&gt; were added to &lt;memoryBacking/&gt; element. Also new
configuration parameter <span class="docutils literal">memory_backing_dir</span> was added to qemu.conf.</p>
</li>
<li><p>network: make openvswitch call timeout configurable</p>
<p>Adding the ability to specify the timeout value in seconds for openvswitch
calls in the libvirtd configuration file.</p>
</li>
<li><p>bhyve: add e1000 NIC support</p>
<p>Add support for e1000 NIC. Previously, the only available option was

</li>
<li><p>libxl: add tunneled migration support</p>
<p>Add tunneled migration to libxl driver, which is always capable of strong
encryption and doesn't require any extra network connection other than
what's required for remote access of libvirtd.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: add rendernode argument</p>
<p>Add a new attribute 'rendernode' to &lt;gl&gt; spice element.</p>
</li>
<li><p>nodedev: add drm capability</p>
<p>Add a new 'drm' capability for Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) devices,
providing device type information.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Add API for individual/specific vCPU hotplug</p>
<p>The new API allows selecting specific vCPUs to be added/removed from the

<li><p>virsh: pool-list: allow both --uuid and --name in one command</p>
<p>Adjust the virsh-pool command to support the --uuid and/or --name options
in order to print just the --name and/or --uuid of pools.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Introduce MTU to domain &lt;interface/&gt; and &lt;network&gt;</p>
<p>Allow setting MTU size for some types of domain interface and network.</p>
</li>
<li><p>libxl: improve support for &lt;timer&gt; configurations</p>
<p>Add support for multiple timers. Extend the tsc timer to support the
emulate mode. Improve conversion of timer XML to/from xl.cfg.</p>
</li>
<li><p>storage: modularize the storage driver</p>
<p>Split up the storage driver backends into loadable modules so that binary
distributions don't have to compromise on shipping the storage driver with
all backends which may pull in too many dependencies.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Bug fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>nodedev: Fabric name must not be required for fc_host capability</p>
<p>fabric_name is one of many fc_host attributes in Linux that is optional and
left to the low-level driver to decide if it is implemented. For example
the zfcp device driver does not provide a fabric name for an fcp host. The
requirement for the existence of a fabric name has been removed by making
it optional.</p>
</li>
<li><p>bhyve: change address allocation schema for SATA disks</p>
<p>Previously, the bhyve driver assigned PCI addresses to SATA disks directly
rather than assigning that to a controller and using SATA addresses for
disks. It was implemented this way because bhyve has no notion of an
explicit SATA controller. However, as this doesn't match libvirt's
understanding of disk addresses, the bhyve driver was changed to follow the
common schema and have PCI addresses for SATA controllers and SATA
addresses for disks. If you're having issues because of this, it's
recommended to edit the domain's XML and remove &lt;address type='pci'&gt; from
the &lt;disk&gt; elements with &lt;target bus='sata'/&gt; and let libvirt regenerate it
properly.</p>
</li>
<li><p>libxl: maximum memory fixes</p>
<p>Fix reporting of domain maximum memory. Fix setting dom0 maximum memory.</p>
</li>
<li><p>libxl: fix disk detach when &lt;driver&gt; not specified</p></li>
<li><p>libxl: fix dom0 autoballooning with Xen 4.8</p></li>
<li><p>qemu: Allow empty script path to &lt;interface/&gt;</p>
<p>Historically, this was always allowed. Unfortunately, due to some rework
done for 1.3.2 release a bug was dragged in which suddenly stop allowing
domain with such configuration to start.</p>

<h1>v3.0.0 (2017-01-17)<a class="headerlink" href="#v3-0-0-2017-01-17" title="Link to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>New features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Domain events for metadata content changes</p>
<p>The domain events framework has a new event ID that can be used to get
notifications when domain metadata content changes.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Event notifications for the secret object</p>
<p>The secret object now supports event notifications, covering lifcycle
changes and secret value changes.</p>
</li>
<li><p>New localPtr attribute for "ip" element in network XML</p></li>
<li><p>qemu: Support QEMU group I/O throttling</p>
<p>Add the capability to allow group I/O throttling via a new domain &lt;disk&gt;
&lt;iotune&gt; subelement "group_name" to allow sharing I/O throttling quota
between multiple drives.</p>
</li>
<li><p>nss: Introduce libvirt_guest</p>
<p>New <span class="docutils literal">libvirt_guest</span> nss module that translates libvirt guest names into
IP addresses.</p>
</li>
<li><p>daemon: Add support for runtime logging settings adjustment</p>
<p>Logging-related settings like log outputs and filters can now be adjusted
during runtime using the admin interface without the necessity of the
daemon's restart.</p>
</li>
<li><p>storage: Add virStorageVolInfoFlags API</p>
<p>Add the API to support using the VIR_STORAGE_VOL_GET_PHYSICAL flag in order
to return the host physical size in bytes of the image container in the
allocation field of the _virStorageVolInfo structure. The --physical flag
has been added to the virsh vol-info command to access the data.</p>
</li>
<li><p>libxl: Implement virDomainGetMaxVcpus API</p></li>
<li><p>storage: Add overwrite flag checking for logical pool</p>
<p>Add support for the OVERWRITE flags for the logical storage backend
including checking for existing data on the target volumes when building a
new logical pool on target volume(s).</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Add support for guest CPU configuration on s390(x)</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improvements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>perf: Add more perf statistics</p>
<p>Add support to get the count of branch instructions executed, branch
misses, bus cycles, stalled frontend cpu cycles, stalled backend cpu
cycles, and ref cpu cycles by applications running on the platform.</p>
</li>
<li><p>conf: Display &lt;physical&gt; for volume xml</p>
<p>Add a display of the &lt;physical&gt; size of a disk volume in the output of the
volume XML.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Use virtio-pci by default for aarch64 mach-virt guests</p>
<p>virtio-pci provides several advantages over virtio-mmio, such as the
ability to hotplug devices and improved performance. While opting in to
virtio-pci has been possible for a while, newly-defined guests will now use
it automatically.</p>
</li>
<li><p>vbox: remove support for VirtualBox 3.x and older</p>
<p>Those old VirtualBox versions have been unsupported by upstream for a long
time and the API of 4.0 and newer has diverged enough to require code
abstractions to handle differences. Removing support for those old versions
drops lots of code from the driver and simplifies the logic to ease
implementation of new features going forward.</p>
</li>
<li><p>virsh: pool-info: introduce option --bytes</p>
<p>Add option --bytes to virsh pool-info in order ti allow display of units in
bytes rather than default of human readable output.</p>
</li>
<li><p>scsi: Add parent wwnn/wwpn or fabric capability for createVport</p>
<p>Improve the algorithm searching for the parent scsi_host device for
vHBA/NPIV scsi_host creation. Rather than supplying the "parent" by name,
it's now possible to define the parent by it's wwnn/wwpn or fabric_wwn in
the node device create XML or the storage pool XML.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: aggregate pcie-root-ports onto multiple functions of a slot</p>
<p>When pcie-root-ports are added to pcie-root in order to provide a place to
connect PCI Express endpoint devices, libvirt now aggregates multiple root
ports together onto the same slot (up to 8 per slot) in order to conserve
slots. Using this method, it's possible to connect more than 200 endpoint
devices to a guest that uses PCIe without requiring setup of any PCIe
switches.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Bug fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>lxc: fix accidental killing of containers during libvirtd restart</p>
<p>The libvirt_lxc process was previously not moved into the container scope.
As a result, if systemd reloads its config after a container is started,
when libvirtd is later restarted it will accidentally kill the containers.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Correct GetBlockInfo values</p>
<p>For an active domain, correct the physical value provided for a raw sparse
file backed storage and the allocation value provided for a qcow2 file
backed storage that hasn't yet been opened on the domain.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Make virtio console usable on ppc64 guests</p>
<p>The chardev detection code has been improved and can now handle this
configuration properly.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Enable mount namespace</p>
<p>To avoid funny races with udev relabelling devices under our hands and to
enhance security, libvirt now spawns each qemu process with its own
<span class="docutils literal">/dev</span> .</p>
</li>
<li><p>storage: Fix implementation of no-overwrite for file system backend</p>
<p>Fix file system storage backend implementation of the OVERWRITE flags to be
consistent between code and documentation. Add checks to ensure that when
building a new file system on a target volume that there is not something
already on the disk in a format that libvirt can recognize.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Create hugepage path on per domain basis</p>
<p>Historically, all hugepage enabled domains shared the same path under
hugetlbfs. This left libvirt unable to correctly set security labels on it.
With this release, however, each domain is put into a separate path which
is also correctly labeled.</p>
</li>
<li><p>conf: Reject domains with duplicate drive addresses</p>
<p>Reject duplicate drive addresses for disks and hostdevs at domain
definition.</p>
</li>
<li><p>libxl: reverse defaults on HVM net device attach</p>
<p>Fixes network interface attach for HVM domains when no model is specified.
Emulated hotplug isn't yet supported and hence we should default to the
general working scenario.</p>
</li>
<li><p>libxl: always enable pae for x86_64 HVM</p>
<p>By default pae is disabled in libxl. Without an explicit &lt;pae/&gt; setting in
the domain &lt;features&gt; configuration, an x86_64 HVM domain would be get an
i686 environment. pae should always be enabled for x86_64 HVM domains.</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Fix XML dump of autogenerated websocket</p>
<p>As a result autogenerated websocket port is regenerated on domain restore,
migration and such as it should be.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>New features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>shmem: Add support for additional models</p>
<p>The shmem device can now utilize QEMU's ivshmem-plain and ivshmem-doorbell,
more modern versions of ivshmem.</p>
</li>
<li><p>vbox: Add VirtualBox 5.1 support</p></li>
<li><p>libssh: New transport</p>
<p>The new libssh transport allows one to connect to a running libvirtd via
SSH, using the libssh library; for example: <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">qemu+libssh://server/system</span></span>
.</p>
</li>
<li><p>vhost-scsi: Add support scsi_host hostdev passthrough</p>
<p>Add the capability to pass through a scsi_host HBA and the associated LUNs
to the guest.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Allow debugging of gluster volumes in qemu</p>
<p>Users can now enable debug logging for native gluster volumes in qemu using
the "gluster_debug_level" option in qemu.conf</p>
</li>
<li><p>Pre-allocate memory slots for memory hotplug</p>
<p>Slot numbers for memory devices are now automatically allocated and thus
persistent. In addition slot numbers can be specified without providing a
base address, which simplifies user configuration</p>
</li>
<li><p>qemu: Express devices will be placed on PCIe bus by default</p>
<p>For machine types that use a PCI Express root bus (e.g. x86_64/Q35 and
aarch64/virt), any unaddressed PCI device that is an Express device (all
virtio-1.0 devices, e1000e, nec-xhci, vfio assigned devices) will be placed
on an Express controller (i.e. a pcie-root-port) instead of a legacy PCI
controller (i.e. pci-bridge) with the root ports added as needed.</p>
